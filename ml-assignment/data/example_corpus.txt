Chapter 1
The Period
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of
wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was
the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of
Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had
everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct
to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period
was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities
insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative
degree of comparison only.
There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on
the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen
with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that
things in general were settled for ever.
It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that
favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her
five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in
the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing
that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and
Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round
dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very
year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.
Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:
which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race
than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of
the Cock-lane brood.
France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her
sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down
hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her
Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane
achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue
torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not
kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks
4

which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.
It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway,
there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already
marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards,
to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it,
terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of
some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered
from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire,
snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer,
Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But
that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work
silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread:
the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake,
was to be atheistical and traitorous.
In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to
justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and
highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families
were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their
furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; the highwayman in
the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and
challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of
“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the
mall was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and
then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mall was robbed in peace; that
magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand
and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the
illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols
fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves
snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court
drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers
fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much
out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy
and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing
up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker
on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in
the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the
5
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s
boy of sixpence.
All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and
close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventyfive. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked
unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain
and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights
with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and
seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures—
the creatures of this chronicle among the rest—along the roads that lay
before them.
Chapter 2
The Mail
It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,
before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The
Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up
Shooter’s Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as
the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for
walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the
harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses
had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach
across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.
Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination,
had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly
in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with
Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.
With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way
through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as
if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver
rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary “Wo-ho! so-hothen!” the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it—
like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got
up the hill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started,
as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.
6
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in
its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding
none. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through
the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as
the waves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to
shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own
workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses
steamed into it, as if they had made it all.
Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by
the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over
the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said,
from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each
was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind,
as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody
on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody
in “the Captain’s” pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable
non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of
the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one
thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter’s Hill,
as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,
and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a
loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,
deposited on a substratum of cutlass.
The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the
guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure
of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit
for the journey.
“Wo-ho!” said the coachman. “So, then! One more pull and you’re
at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get
you to it!—Joe!”
“Halloa!” the guard replied.
“What o’clock do you make it, Joe?”
“Ten minutes, good, past eleven.”
“My blood!” ejaculated the vexed coachman, “and not atop of
Shooter’s yet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!”
7
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed
suit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of
its passengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the
coach stopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the
three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little
ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair
way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.
The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses
stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for
the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.
“Tst! Joe!” cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down
from his box.
“What do you say, Tom?”
They both listened.
“I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe.”
“I say a horse at a gallop, Tom,” returned the guard, leaving his
hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place. “Gentlemen! In the
kings name, all of you!”
With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood
on the offensive.
The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to
follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of;
they re-mained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.
The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the
emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.
The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet
indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion
to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet
pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the
breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.
The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.
“So-ho!” the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. “Yo there!
Stand! I shall fire!”
8
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man’s voice called from the mist, “Is that the Dover mail?”
“Never you mind what it is!” the guard retorted. “What are you?”
“Is that the Dover mail?”
“Why do you want to know?”
“I want a passenger, if it is.”
“What passenger?”
“Mr. Jarvis Lorry.”
Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.
The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.
“Keep where you are,” the guard called to the voice in the mist,
“because, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your
lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.”
“What is the matter?” asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. “Who wants me? Is it Jerry?”
(“I don’t like Jerry’s voice, if it is Jerry,” growled the guard to himself.
“He’s hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.”)
“Yes, Mr. Lorry.”
“What is the matter?”
“A despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.”
“I know this messenger, guard,” said Mr. Lorry, getting down into
the road—assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other
two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the
door, and pulled up the window. “He may come close; there’s nothing
wrong.”
“I hope there ain’t, but I can’t make so ’Nation sure of that,” said
the guard, in gruff soliloquy. “Hallo you!”
“Well! And hallo you!” said Jerry, more hoarsely than before.
“Come on at a footpace! d’ye mind me? And if you’ve got holsters
to that saddle o’ yourn, don’t let me see your hand go nigh ’em. For I’m
a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of
Lead. So now let’s look at you.”
The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying
mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood. The
rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider’s horse was blown, and both horse
and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat
of the man.
9
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Guard!” said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence.
The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised
blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, “Sir.”
“There is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson’s Bank. You
must know Tellson’s Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business.
A crown to drink. I may read this?”
“If so be as you’re quick, sir.”
He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read—
first to himself and then aloud: “ ‘Wait at Dover for Mam’selle.’ It’s not
long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, recalled to life.”
Jerry started in his saddle. “That’s a Blazing strange answer, too,”
said he, at his hoarsest.
“Take that message back, and they will know that I received this, as
well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.”
With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in;
not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a
general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to
escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.
The coach lumbered on again, with heavier wreaths of mist closing
round it as it began the descent. The guard soon replaced his blunderbuss in his arm-chest, and, having looked to the rest of its contents,
and having looked to the supplementary pistols that he wore in his belt,
looked to a smaller chest beneath his seat, in which there were a few
smith’s tools, a couple of torches, and a tinder-box. For he was furnished with that completeness that if the coach-lamps had been blown
and stormed out, which did occasionally happen, he had only to shut
himself up inside, keep the flint and steel sparks well off the straw, and
get a light with tolerable safety and ease (if he were lucky) in five minutes.
“Tom!” softly over the coach roof.
“Hallo, Joe.”
“Did you hear the message?”
“I did, Joe.”
“What did you make of it, Tom?”
“Nothing at all, Joe.”
“That’s a coincidence, too,” the guard mused, “for I made the same
of it myself.”
10
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile,
not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and
shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding
about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavilysplashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing
and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill.
“After that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won’t trust your
fore-legs till I get you on the level,” said this hoarse messenger, glancing
at his mare. “ ‘Recalled to life.’ That’s a Blazing strange message. Much
of that wouldn’t do for you, Jerry! I say, Jerry! You’d be in a Blazing
bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!”
Chapter 3
The Night Shadows
A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn
consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those
darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every
one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret
to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself,
is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that
I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into
the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights
glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things
submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring,
for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that
the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is
dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it
is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was
always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life’s
end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is
there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their
innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?
11
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
As to this, his natural and not to be alienated inheritance, the messenger on horseback had exactly the same possessions as the King, the
first Minister of State, or the richest merchant in London. So with the
three passengers shut up in the narrow compass of one lumbering old
mail coach; they were mysteries to one another, as complete as if each
had been in his own coach and six, or his own coach and sixty, with the
breadth of a county between him and the next.
The messenger rode back at an easy trot, stopping pretty often at
ale-houses by the way to drink, but evincing a tendency to keep his
own counsel, and to keep his hat cocked over his eyes. He had eyes
that assorted very well with that decoration, being of a surface black,
with no depth in the colour or form, and much too near together—as
if they were afraid of being found out in something, singly, if they kept
too far apart. They had a sinister expression, under an old cocked-hat
like a three-cornered spittoon, and over a great muffler for the chin and
throat, which descended nearly to the wearer’s knees. When he stopped
for drink, he moved this muffler with his left hand, only while he poured
his liquor in with his right; as soon as that was done, he muffled again.
“No, Jerry, no!” said the messenger, harping on one theme as he
rode. “It wouldn’t do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it
wouldn’t suit your line of business! Recalled—! Bust me if I don’t think
he’d been a drinking!”
His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown,
which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all
over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was
so like Smith’s work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked
wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have
declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over.
While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the
night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson’s Bank, by Temple Bar,
who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the
night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took
such shapes to the mare as arose out of her private topics of uneasiness.
They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road.
What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped
upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom,
likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their
dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.
12
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Tellson’s Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger—
with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in
it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving
him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt—nodded in
his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coachlamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite
passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The
rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were
honoured in five minutes than even Tellson’s, with all its foreign and
home connection, ever paid in thrice the time. Then the strong-rooms
underground, at Tellson’s, with such of their valuable stores and secrets
as were known to the passenger (and it was not a little that he knew
about them), opened before him, and he went in among them with the
great keys and the feebly-burning candle, and found them safe, and
strong, and sound, and still, just as he had last seen them.
But, though the bank was almost always with him, and though the
coach (in a confused way, like the presence of pain under an opiate) was
always with him, there was another current of impression that never
ceased to run, all through the night. He was on his way to dig some one
out of a grave.
Now, which of the multitude of faces that showed themselves before
him was the true face of the buried person, the shadows of the night did
not indicate; but they were all the faces of a man of five-and-forty by
years, and they differed principally in the passions they expressed, and
in the ghastliness of their worn and wasted state. Pride, contempt, defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another;
so did varieties of sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands
and figures. But the face was in the main one face, and every head was
prematurely white. A hundred times the dozing passenger inquired of
this spectre:
“Buried how long?”
The answer was always the same: “Almost eighteen years.”
“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
“Long ago.”
“You know that you are recalled to life?”
“They tell me so.”
“I hope you care to live?”
“I can’t say.”
“Shall I show her to you? Will you come and see her?”
13
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The answers to this question were various and contradictory. Sometimes the broken reply was, “Wait! It would kill me if I saw her too
soon.” Sometimes, it was given in a tender rain of tears, and then it
was, “Take me to her.” Sometimes it was staring and bewildered, and
then it was, “I don’t know her. I don’t understand.”
After such imaginary discourse, the passenger in his fancy would
dig, and dig, dig—now with a spade, now with a great key, now with
his hands—to dig this wretched creature out. Got out at last, with earth
hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust.
The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to
get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek.
Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the
moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside
retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into
the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the
real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be
there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he
would accost it again.
“Buried how long?”
“Almost eighteen years.”
“I hope you care to live?”
“I can’t say.”
Dig—dig—dig—until an impatient movement from one of the two
passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm
securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid
away into the bank and the grave.
“Buried how long?”
“Almost eighteen years.”
“You had abandoned all hope of being dug out?”
“Long ago.”
The words were still in his hearing as just spoken—distinctly in his
hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life—when the weary
passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the
shadows of the night were gone.
He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was
a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left
last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood,
14
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained
upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear,
and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful.
“Eighteen years!” said the passenger, looking at the sun. “Gracious
Creator of day! To be buried alive for eighteen years!”

When the mail got successfully to Dover, in the course of the forenoon,
the head drawer at the Royal George Hotel opened the coach-door as
his custom was. He did it with some flourish of ceremony, for a mail
journey from London in winter was an achievement to congratulate an
adventurous traveller upon.
By that time, there was only one adventurous traveller left be congratulated: for the two others had been set down at their respective
roadside destinations. The mildewy inside of the coach, with its damp
and dirty straw, its disageeable smell, and its obscurity, was rather like
a larger dog-kennel. Mr. Lorry, the passenger, shaking himself out of it
in chains of straw, a tangle of shaggy wrapper, flapping hat, and muddy
legs, was rather like a larger sort of dog.
“There will be a packet to Calais, tomorrow, drawer?”
“Yes, sir, if the weather holds and the wind sets tolerable fair. The
tide will serve pretty nicely at about two in the afternoon, sir. Bed, sir?”
“I shall not go to bed till night; but I want a bedroom, and a barber.”
“And then breakfast, sir? Yes, sir. That way, sir, if you please. Show
Concord! Gentleman’s valise and hot water to Concord. Pull off gentleman’s boots in Concord. (You will find a fine sea-coal fire, sir.) Fetch
barber to Concord. Stir about there, now, for Concord!”
The Concord bed-chamber being always assigned to a passenger by
the mail, and passengers by the mail being always heavily wrapped up
from head to foot, the room had the odd interest for the establishment
of the Royal George, that although but one kind of man was seen to go
into it, all kinds and varieties of men came out of it. Consequently, another drawer, and two porters, and several maids and the landlady, were
all loitering by accident at various points of the road between the Concord and the coffee-room, when a gentleman of sixty, formally dressed
15
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in a brown suit of clothes, pretty well worn, but very well kept, with
large square cuffs and large flaps to the pockets, passed along on his
way to his breakfast.
The coffee-room had no other occupant, that forenoon, than the
gentleman in brown. His breakfast-table was drawn before the fire, and
as he sat, with its light shining on him, waiting for the meal, he sat so
still, that he might have been sitting for his portrait.
Very orderly and methodical he looked, with a hand on each knee,
and a loud watch ticking a sonorous sermon under his flapped waistcoat, as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and
evanescence of the brisk fire. He had a good leg, and was a little vain
of it, for his brown stockings fitted sleek and close, and were of a fine
texture; his shoes and buckles, too, though plain, were trim. He wore
an odd little sleek crisp flaxen wig, setting very close to his head: which
wig, it is to be presumed, was made of hair, but which looked far more
as though it were spun from filaments of silk or glass. His linen, though
not of a fineness in accordance with his stockings, was as white as the
tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach, or the specks
of sail that glinted in the sunlight far at sea. A face habitually suppressed
and quieted, was still lighted up under the quaint wig by a pair of moist
bright eyes that it must have cost their owner, in years gone by, some
pains to drill to the composed and reserved expression of Tellson’s Bank.
He had a healthy colour in his cheeks, and his face, though lined, bore
few traces of anxiety. But, perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks in
Tellson’s Bank were principally occupied with the cares of other people;
and perhaps second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily
off and on.
Completing his resemblance to a man who was sitting for his portrait, Mr. Lorry dropped off to sleep. The arrival of his breakfast roused
him, and he said to the drawer, as he moved his chair to it:
“I wish accommodation prepared for a young lady who may come
here at any time to-day. She may ask for Mr. Jarvis Lorry, or she may
only ask for a gentleman from Tellson’s Bank. Please to let me know.”
“Yes, sir. Tellson’s Bank in London, sir?”
“Yes.”
“Yes, sir. We have oftentimes the honour to entertain your gentlemen in their travelling backwards and forwards betwixt London and
Paris, sir. A vast deal of travelling, sir, in Tellson and Company’s
House.”
16
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes. We are quite a French House, as well as an English one.”
“Yes, sir. Not much in the habit of such travelling yourself, I think,
sir?”
“Not of late years. It is fifteen years since we—since I—came last
from France.”
“Indeed, sir? That was before my time here, sir. Before our people’s
time here, sir. The George was in other hands at that time, sir.”
“I believe so.”
“But I would hold a pretty wager, sir, that a House like Tellson and
Company was flourishing, a matter of fifty, not to speak of fifteen years
ago?”
“You might treble that, and say a hundred and fifty, yet not be far
from the truth.”
“Indeed, sir!”
Rounding his mouth and both his eyes, as he stepped backward
from the table, the waiter shifted his napkin from his right arm to his
left, dropped into a comfortable attitude, and stood surveying the guest
while he ate and drank, as from an observatory or watchtower. According to the immemorial usage of waiters in all ages.
When Mr. Lorry had finished his breakfast, he went out for a stroll
on the beach. The little narrow, crooked town of Dover hid itself away
from the beach, and ran its head into the chalk cliffs, like a marine ostrich. The beach was a desert of heaps of sea and stones tumbling wildly
about, and the sea did what it liked, and what it liked was destruction.
It thundered at the town, and thundered at the cliffs, and brought the
coast down, madly. The air among the houses was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped
in it, as sick people went down to be dipped in the sea. A little fishing
was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night, and
looking seaward: particularly at those times when the tide made, and
was near flood. Small tradesmen, who did no business whatever, sometimes unaccountably realised large fortunes, and it was remarkable that
nobody in the neighbourhood could endure a lamplighter.
As the day declined into the afternoon, and the air, which had been
at intervals clear enough to allow the French coast to be seen, became
again charged with mist and vapour, Mr. Lorry’s thoughts seemed to
cloud too. When it was dark, and he sat before the coffee-room fire,
awaiting his dinner as he had awaited his breakfast, his mind was busily
digging, digging, digging, in the live red coals.
17
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
A bottle of good claret after dinner does a digger in the red coals no
harm, otherwise than as it has a tendency to throw him out of work.
Mr. Lorry had been idle a long time, and had just poured out his last
glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever
to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got
to the end of a bottle, when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow
street, and rumbled into the inn-yard.
He set down his glass untouched. “This is Mam’selle!” said he.
In a very few minutes the waiter came in to announce that Miss
Manette had arrived from London, and would be happy to see the gentleman from Tellson’s.
“So soon?”
Miss Manette had taken some refreshment on the road, and required
none then, and was extremely anxious to see the gentleman from Tellson’s immediately, if it suited his pleasure and convenience.
The gentleman from Tellson’s had nothing left for it but to empty
his glass with an air of stolid desperation, settle his odd little flaxen wig
at the ears, and follow the waiter to Miss Manette’s apartment. It was a
large, dark room, furnished in a funereal manner with black horsehair,
and loaded with heavy dark tables. These had been oiled and oiled,
until the two tall candles on the table in the middle of the room were
gloomily reflected on every leaf; as if they were buried, in deep graves of
black mahogany, and no light to speak of could be expected from them
until they were dug out.
The obscurity was so difficult to penetrate that Mr. Lorry, picking
his way over the well-worn Turkey carpet, supposed
Miss Manette to be, for the moment, in some adjacent room, until,
having got past the two tall candles, he saw standing to receive him
by the table between them and the fire, a young lady of not more than
seventeen, in a riding-cloak, and still holding her straw travelling-hat by
its ribbon in her hand. As his eyes rested on a short, slight, pretty figure,
a quantity of golden hair, a pair of blue eyes that met his own with an
inquiring look, and a forehead with a singular capacity (remembering
how young and smooth it was), of rifting and knitting itself into an
expression that was not quite one of perplexity, or wonder, or alarm,
or merely of a bright fixed attention, though it included all the four
expressions-as his eyes rested on these things, a sudden vivid likeness
passed before him, of a child whom he had held in his arms on the
passage across that very Channel, one cold time, when the hail drifted
18
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
heavily and the sea ran high. The likeness passed away, like a breath
along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of
which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all
cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities
of the feminine gender-and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette.
“Pray take a seat, sir.” In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a
little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed.
“I kiss your hand, miss,” said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an
earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat.
“I received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that
some intelligence—or discovery—”
“The word is not material, miss; either word will do.”
“—respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never
saw—so long dead—”
Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the
hospital procession of negro cupids. As if they had any help for anybody
in their absurd baskets!
“—rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris
for the purpose.”
“Myself.”
“As I was prepared to hear, sir.”
She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days),
with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and
wiser he was than she. He made her another bow.
“I replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by
those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go
to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could
go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place
myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman’s protection.
The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after
him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.”
“I was happy,” said Mr. Lorry, “to be entrusted with the charge. I
shall be more happy to execute it.”
“Sir, I thank you indeed. I thank you very gratefully. It was told
me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me the details of
the business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a surprising
nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a
strong and eager interest to know what they are.”
19
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Naturally,” said Mr. Lorry. “Yes—I—”
After a pause, he added, again settling the crisp flaxen wig at the
ears, “It is very difficult to begin.”
He did not begin, but, in his indecision, met her glance. The young
forehead lifted itself into that singular expression—but it was pretty
and characteristic, besides being singular—and she raised her hand, as
if with an involuntary action she caught at, or stayed some passing
shadow.
“Are you quite a stranger to me, sir?”
“Am I not?” Mr. Lorry opened his hands, and extended them outwards with an argumentative smile.
Between the eyebrows and just over the little feminine nose, the line
of which was as delicate and fine as it was possible to be, the expression
deepened itself as she took her seat thoughtfully in the chair by which
she had hitherto remained standing. He watched her as she mused, and
the moment she raised her eyes again, went on:
“In your adopted country, I presume, I cannot do better than address
you as a young English lady, Miss Manette?”
“If you please, sir.”
“Miss Manette, I am a man of business. I have a business charge to
acquit myself of. In your reception of it, don’t heed me any more than
if I was a speaking machine-truly, I am not much else. I will, with your
leave, relate to you, miss, the story of one of our customers.”
“Story!”
He seemed wilfully to mistake the word she had repeated, when he
added, in a hurry, “Yes, customers; in the banking business we usually
call our connection our customers. He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements—a Doctor.”
“Not of Beauvais?”
“Why, yes, of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of Beauvais. Like Monsieur Manette, your father, the
gentleman was of repute in Paris. I had the honour of knowing him
there. Our relations were business relations, but confidential. I was at
that time in our French House, and had been—oh! twenty years.”
“At that time—I may ask, at what time, sir?”
“I speak, miss, of twenty years ago. He married—an English lady—
and I was one of the trustees. His affairs, like the affairs of many other
French gentlemen and French families, were entirely in Tellson’s hands.
In a similar way I am, or I have been, trustee of one kind or other for
20
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
scores of our customers. These are mere business relations, miss; there
is no friendship in them, no particular interest, nothing like sentiment.
I have passed from one to another, in the course of my business life,
just as I pass from one of our customers to another in the course of my
business day; in short, I have no feelings; I am a mere machine. To go
on—”
“But this is my father’s story, sir; and I begin to think”—the curiously roughened forehead was very intent upon him—“that when I was
left an orphan through my mother’s surviving my father only two years,
it was you who brought me to England. I am almost sure it was you.”
Mr. Lorry took the hesitating little hand that confidingly advanced
to take his, and he put it with some ceremony to his lips. He then
conducted the young lady straightway to her chair again, and, holding
the chair-back with his left hand, and using his right by turns to rub his
chin, pull his wig at the ears, or point what he said, stood looking down
into her face while she sat looking up into his.
“Miss Manette, it was I. And you will see how truly I spoke of
myself just now, in saying I had no feelings, and that all the relations
I hold with my fellow-creatures are mere business relations, when you
reflect that I have never seen you since. No; you have been the ward
of Tellson’s House since, and I have been busy with the other business
of Tellson’s House since. Feelings! I have no time for them, no chance
of them. I pass my whole life, miss, in turning an immense pecuniary
Mangle.”
After this odd description of his daily routine of employment, Mr.
Lorry flattened his flaxen wig upon his head with both hands (which
was most unnecessary, for nothing could be flatter than its shining surface was before), and resumed his former attitude.
“So far, miss (as you have remarked), this is the story of your regretted father. Now comes the difference. If your father had not died when
he did—Don’t be frightened! How you start!”
She did, indeed, start. And she caught his wrist with both her hands.
“Pray,” said Mr. Lorry, in a soothing tone, bringing his left hand
from the back of the chair to lay it on the supplicatory fingers that
clasped him in so violent a tremble: “pray control your agitation—a
matter of business. As I was saying—”
Her look so discomposed him that he stopped, wandered, and began
anew:
“As I was saying; if Monsieur Manette had not died; if he had sud21
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
denly and silently disappeared; if he had been spirited away; if it had
not been difficult to guess to what dreadful place, though no art could
trace him; if he had an enemy in some compatriot who could exercise a
privilege that I in my own time have known the boldest people afraid to
speak of in a whisper, across the water there; for instance, the privilege
of filling up blank forms for the consignment of any one to the oblivion
of a prison for any length of time; if his wife had implored the king,
the queen, the court, the clergy, for any tidings of him, and all quite in
vain;—then the history of your father would have been the history of
this unfortunate gentleman, the Doctor of Beauvais.”
“I entreat you to tell me more, sir.”
“I will. I am going to. You can bear it?”
“I can bear anything but the uncertainty you leave me in at this
moment.”
“You speak collectedly, and you—are collected. That’s good!”
(Though his manner was less satisfied than his words.) “A matter of
business. Regard it as a matter of business-business that must be done.
Now if this doctor’s wife, though a lady of great courage and spirit, had
suffered so intensely from this cause before her little child was born—”
“The little child was a daughter, sir.”
“A daughter. A-a-matter of business—don’t be distressed. Miss, if
the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born,
that she came to the determination of sparing the poor child the inheritance of any part of the agony she had known the pains of, by rearing
her in the belief that her father was dead—No, don’t kneel! In Heaven’s
name why should you kneel to me!”
“For the truth. O dear, good, compassionate sir, for the truth!”
“A-a matter of business. You confuse me, and how can I transact
business if I am confused? Let us be clear-headed. If you could kindly
mention now, for instance, what nine times ninepence are, or how many
shillings in twenty guineas, it would be so encouraging. I should be so
much more at my ease about your state of mind.”
Without directly answering to this appeal, she sat so still when he
had very gently raised her, and the hands that had not ceased to clasp
his wrists were so much more steady than they had been, that she communicated some reassurance to Mr. Jarvis Lorry.
“That’s right, that’s right. Courage! Business! You have business
before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course
with you. And when she died—I believe broken-hearted—having never
22
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two
years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the
dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon
wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering
years.”
As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the
flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been
already tinged with grey.
“You know that your parents had no great possession, and that what
they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no
new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but—”
He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the
forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was
now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror.
“But he has been—been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is
too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the
best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old
servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you,
to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.”
A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his. She said,
in a low, distinct, awe-stricken voice, as if she were saying it in a dream,
“I am going to see his Ghost! It will be his Ghost—not him!”
Mr. Lorry quietly chafed the hands that held his arm. “There, there,
there! See now, see now! The best and the worst are known to you,
now. You are well on your way to the poor wronged gentleman, and,
with a fair sea voyage, and a fair land journey, you will be soon at his
dear side.”
She repeated in the same tone, sunk to a whisper, “I have been free,
I have been happy, yet his Ghost has never haunted me!”
“Only one thing more,” said Mr. Lorry, laying stress upon it as a
wholesome means of enforcing her attention: “he has been found under
another name; his own, long forgotten or long concealed. It would be
worse than useless now to inquire which; worse than useless to seek to
know whether he has been for years overlooked, or always designedly
held prisoner. It would be worse than useless now to make any inquiries,
because it would be dangerous. Better not to mention the subject, anywhere or in any way, and to remove him—for a while at all events—out
of France. Even I, safe as an Englishman, and even Tellson’s, important
as they are to French credit, avoid all naming of the matter. I carry
23
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
about me, not a scrap of writing openly referring to it. This is a secret
service altogether. My credentials, entries, and memoranda, are all comprehended in the one line, ‘Recalled to Life;’ which may mean anything.
But what is the matter! She doesn’t notice a word! Miss Manette!”
Perfectly still and silent, and not even fallen back in her chair, she
sat under his hand, utterly insensible; with her eyes open and fixed
upon him, and with that last expression looking as if it were carved
or branded into her forehead. So close was her hold upon his arm, that
he feared to detach himself lest he should hurt her; therefore he called
out loudly for assistance without moving.
A wild-looking woman, whom even in his agitation, Mr. Lorry observed to be all of a red colour, and to have red hair, and to be dressed
in some extraordinary tight-fitting fashion, and to have on her head a
most wonderful bonnet like a Grenadier wooden measure, and good
measure too, or a great Stilton cheese, came running into the room in
advance of the inn servants, and soon settled the question of his detachment from the poor young lady, by laying a brawny hand upon his chest,
and sending him flying back against the nearest wall.
(“I really think this must be a man!” was Mr. Lorry’s breathless
reflection, simultaneously with his coming against the wall.)
“Why, look at you all!” bawled this figure, addressing the inn servants. “Why don’t you go and fetch things, instead of standing there
staring at me? I am not so much to look at, am I? Why don’t you go
and fetch things? I’ll let you know, if you don’t bring smelling-salts,
cold water, and vinegar, quick, I will.”
There was an immediate dispersal for these restoratives, and she
softly laid the patient on a sofa, and tended her with great skill and
gentleness: calling her “my precious!” and “my bird!” and spreading
her golden hair aside over her shoulders with great pride and care.
“And you in brown!” she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry;
“couldn’t you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her
to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do
you call that being a Banker?”
Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to
answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler
sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the
inn servants under the mysterious penalty of “letting them know” something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge
by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping
24
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
head upon her shoulder.
“I hope she will do well now,” said Mr. Lorry.
“No thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!”
“I hope,” said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and
humility, “that you accompany Miss Manette to France?”
“A likely thing, too!” replied the strong woman. “If it was ever
intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence
would have cast my lot in an island?”
This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it.
Chapter 5
The Wine-shop
A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The
accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled
out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside
the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.
All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their
idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular
stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have
thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them,
had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own
jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down,
made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help
women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all
run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the
puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women’s heads, which were squeezed dry into infants’
mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it
ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here
and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of
the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments
with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and
not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along
25
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody
acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence.
A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices—voices of men,
women, and children—resounded in the street while this wine game
lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness.
There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on
the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially
among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking
of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a
dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had
been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these
demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out. The man
who had left his saw sticking in the firewood he was cutting, set it in
motion again; the women who had left on a door-step the little pot of
hot ashes, at which she had been trying to soften the pain in her own
starved fingers and toes, or in those of her child, returned to it; men
with bare arms, matted locks, and cadaverous faces, who had emerged
into the winter light from cellars, moved away, to descend again; and
a gloom gathered on the scene that appeared more natural to it than
sunshine.
The wine was red wine, and had stained the ground of the narrow
street in the suburb of Saint Antoine, in Paris, where it was spilled. It
had stained many hands, too, and many faces, and many naked feet,
and many wooden shoes. The hands of the man who sawed the wood,
left red marks on the billets; and the forehead of the woman who nursed
her baby, was stained with the stain of the old rag she wound about her
head again. Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask,
had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so
besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than
in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees—
blood.
The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the
street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there.
And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it
was heavy-cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in
waiting on the saintly presence-nobles of great power all of them; but,
most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous
26
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in
and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every
vestige of a garment that the wind shook. The mill which had worked
them down, was the mill that grinds young people old; the children had
ancient faces and grave voices; and upon them, and upon the grown
faces, and ploughed into every furrow of age and coming up afresh,
was the sigh, Hunger. It was prevalent everywhere. Hunger was pushed
out of the tall houses, in the wretched clothing that hung upon poles
and lines; Hunger was patched into them with straw and rag and wood
and paper; Hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off; Hunger stared down from the
smokeless chimneys, and started up from the filthy street that had no
offal, among its refuse, of anything to eat. Hunger was the inscription
on the baker’s shelves, written in every small loaf of his scanty stock
of bad bread; at the sausage-shop, in every dead-dog preparation that
was offered for sale. Hunger rattled its dry bones among the roasting
chestnuts in the turned cylinder; Hunger was shred into atomics in every
farthing porringer of husky chips of potato, fried with some reluctant
drops of oil.
Its abiding place was in all things fitted to it. A narrow winding
street, full of offence and stench, with other narrow winding streets
diverging, all peopled by rags and nightcaps, and all smelling of rags
and nightcaps, and all visible things with a brooding look upon them
that looked ill. In the hunted air of the people there was yet some
wild-beast thought of the possibility of turning at bay. Depressed and
slinking though they were, eyes of fire were not wanting among them;
nor compressed lips, white with what they suppressed; nor foreheads
knitted into the likeness of the gallows-rope they mused about enduring, or inflicting. The trade signs (and they were almost as many as the
shops) were, all, grim illustrations of Want. The butcher and the porkman painted up, only the leanest scrags of meat; the baker, the coarsest
of meagre loaves. The people rudely pictured as drinking in the wineshops, croaked over their scanty measures of thin wine and beer, and
were gloweringly confidential together. Nothing was represented in a
flourishing condition, save tools and weapons; but, the cutler’s knives
and axes were sharp and bright, the smith’s hammers were heavy, and
the gunmaker’s stock was murderous. The crippling stones of the pavement, with their many little reservoirs of mud and water, had no footways, but broke off abruptly at the doors. The kennel, to make amends,
27
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ran down the middle of the street—when it ran at all: which was only after heavy rains, and then it ran, by many eccentric fits, into the houses.
Across the streets, at wide intervals, one clumsy lamp was slung by a
rope and pulley; at night, when the lamplighter had let these down, and
lighted, and hoisted them again, a feeble grove of dim wicks swung in a
sickly manner overhead, as if they were at sea. Indeed they were at sea,
and the ship and crew were in peril of tempest.
For, the time was to come, when the gaunt scarecrows of that region
should have watched the lamplighter, in their idleness and hunger, so
long, as to conceive the idea of improving on his method, and hauling
up men by those ropes and pulleys, to flare upon the darkness of their
condition. But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew
over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine
of song and feather, took no warning.
The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside
it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle
for the lost wine. “It’s not my affair,” said he, with a final shrug of
the shoulders. “The people from the market did it. Let them bring
another.”
There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke,
he called to him across the way:
“Say, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?”
The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often
the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is
often the way with his tribe too.
“What now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?” said the wineshop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful
of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it. “Why do you
write in the public streets? Is there—tell me thou—is there no other
place to write such words in?”
In his expostulation he dropped his cleaner hand (perhaps accidentally, perhaps not) upon the joker’s heart. The joker rapped it with
his own, took a nimble spring upward, and came down in a fantastic
dancing attitude, with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into
his hand, and held out. A joker of an extremely, not to say wolfishly
practical character, he looked, under those circumstances.
“Put it on, put it on,” said the other. “Call wine, wine; and finish
there.” With that advice, he wiped his soiled hand upon the joker’s
28
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
dress, such as it was—quite deliberately, as having dirtied the hand on
his account; and then recrossed the road and entered the wine-shop.
This wine-shop keeper was a bull-necked, martial-looking man of
thirty, and he should have been of a hot temperament, for, although it
was a bitter day, he wore no coat, but carried one slung over his shoulder.
His shirt-sleeves were rolled up, too, and his brown arms were bare to
the elbows. Neither did he wear anything more on his head than his
own crisply-curling short dark hair. He was a dark man altogether, with
good eyes and a good bold breadth between them. Good-humoured
looking on the whole, but implacable-looking, too; evidently a man of
a strong resolution and a set purpose; a man not desirable to be met,
rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side, for nothing
would turn the man.
Madame Defarge, his wife, sat in the shop behind the counter as he
came in. Madame Defarge was a stout woman of about his own age,
with a watchful eye that seldom seemed to look at anything, a large
hand heavily ringed, a steady face, strong features, and great composure
of manner. There was a character about Madame Defarge, from which
one might have predicated that she did not often make mistakes against
herself in any of the reckonings over which she presided. Madame Defarge being sensitive to cold, was wrapped in fur, and had a quantity
of bright shawl twined about her head, though not to the concealment
of her large earrings. Her knitting was before her, but she had laid
it down to pick her teeth with a toothpick. Thus engaged, with her
right elbow supported by her left hand, Madame Defarge said nothing
when her lord came in, but coughed just one grain of cough. This, in
combination with the lifting of her darkly defined eyebrows over her
toothpick by the breadth of a line, suggested to her husband that he
would do well to look round the shop among the customers, for any
new customer who had dropped in while he stepped over the way.
The wine-shop keeper accordingly rolled his eyes about, until they
rested upon an elderly gentleman and a young lady, who were seated in
a corner. Other company were there: two playing cards, two playing
dominoes, three standing by the counter lengthening out a short supply
of wine. As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly
gentleman said in a look to the young lady, “This is our man.”
“What the devil do you do in that galley there?” said Monsieur
Defarge to himself; “I don’t know you.”
But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into dis29
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
course with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the
counter.
“How goes it, Jacques?” said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. “Is all the spilt wine swallowed?”
“Every drop, Jacques,” answered Monsieur Defarge.
When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of
cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
“It is not often,” said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur
Defarge, “that many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine,
or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?”
“It is so, Jacques,” Monsieur Defarge returned.
At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge,
still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another
grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line.
The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty
drinking vessel and smacked his lips.
“Ah! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle
always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I
right, Jacques?”
“You are right, Jacques,” was the response of Monsieur Defarge.
This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the
moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat.
“Hold then! True!” muttered her husband. “Gentlemen—my wife!”
The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with
three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head,
and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner
round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness
and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it.
“Gentlemen,” said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, “good day. The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion,
that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on
the fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard
close to the left here,” pointing with his hand, “near to the window of
my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already
been there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!”
They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur
Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentle30
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
man advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word.
“Willingly, sir,” said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with
him to the door.
Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first
word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not
lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then
beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge
knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing.
Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop
thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed
his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black
courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses,
inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry
to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one
knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips. It was a
gentle action, but not at all gently done; a very remarkable transformation had come over him in a few seconds. He had no good-humour in
his face, nor any openness of aspect left, but had become a secret, angry,
dangerous man.
“It is very high; it is a little difficult. Better to begin slowly.” Thus,
Monsieur Defarge, in a stern voice, to Mr. Lorry, as they began ascending the stairs.
“Is he alone?” the latter whispered.
“Alone! God help him, who should be with him!” said the other, in
the same low voice.
“Is he always alone, then?”
“Yes.”
“Of his own desire?”
“Of his own necessity. As he was, when I first saw him after they
found me and demanded to know if I would take him, and, at my peril
be discreet—as he was then, so he is now.”
“He is greatly changed?”
“Changed!”
The keeper of the wine-shop stopped to strike the wall with his hand,
and mutter a tremendous curse. No direct answer could have been half
so forcible. Mr. Lorry’s spirits grew heavier and heavier, as he and his
two companions ascended higher and higher.
Such a staircase, with its accessories, in the older and more crowded
parts of Paris, would be bad enough now; but, at that time, it was vile
31
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
indeed to unaccustomed and unhardened senses. Every little habitation
within the great foul nest of one high building—that is to say, the room
or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase—left
its own heap of refuse on its own landing, besides flinging other refuse
from its own windows. The uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered, would have polluted the air, even if poverty and
deprivation had not loaded it with their intangible impurities; the two
bad sources combined made it almost insupportable. Through such
an atmosphere, by a steep dark shaft of dirt and poison, the way lay.
Yielding to his own disturbance of mind, and to his young companion’s
agitation, which became greater every instant, Mr. Jarvis Lorry twice
stopped to rest. Each of these stoppages was made at a doleful grating,
by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted, seemed
to escape, and all spoilt and sickly vapours seemed to crawl in. Through
the rusted bars, tastes, rather than glimpses, were caught of the jumbled
neighbourhood; and nothing within range, nearer or lower than the
summits of the two great towers of Notre-Dame, had any promise on it
of healthy life or wholesome aspirations.
At last, the top of the staircase was gained, and they stopped for the
third time. There was yet an upper staircase, of a steeper inclination
and of contracted dimensions, to be ascended, before the garret story
was reached. The keeper of the wine-shop, always going a little in advance, and always going on the side which Mr. Lorry took, as though
he dreaded to be asked any question by the young lady, turned himself
about here, and, carefully feeling in the pockets of the coat he carried
over his shoulder, took out a key.
“The door is locked then, my friend?” said Mr. Lorry, surprised.
“Ay. Yes,” was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge.
“You think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?”
“I think it necessary to turn the key.” Monsieur Defarge whispered
it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily.
“Why?”
“Why! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would
be frightened-rave-tear himself to pieces-die-come to I know not what
harm—if his door was left open.”
“Is it possible!” exclaimed Mr. Lorry.
“Is it possible!” repeated Defarge, bitterly. “Yes. And a beautiful
world we live in, when it is possible, and when many other such things
32
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
are possible, and not only possible, but done—done, see you!—under
that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.”
This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a
word of it had reached the young lady’s ears. But, by this time she
trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep
anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it
incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.
“Courage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in
a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then,
all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring
to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That’s
well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!”
They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they
were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came
all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close
together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the
room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in
the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and
rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been
drinking in the wine-shop.
“I forgot them in the surprise of your visit,” explained Monsieur
Defarge. “Leave us, good boys; we have business here.”
The three glided by, and went silently down.
There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of
the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr.
Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger:
“Do you make a show of Monsieur Manette?”
“I show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.”
“Is that well?”
“I think it is well.”
“Who are the few? How do you choose them?”
“I choose them as real men, of my name—Jacques is my name—to
whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is
another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.”
With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and
looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again,
he struck twice or thrice upon the door—evidently with no other object
than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key
across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and
33
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
turned it as heavily as he could.
The door slowly opened inward under his hand, and he looked into
the room and said something. A faint voice answered something. Little
more than a single syllable could have been spoken on either side.
He looked back over his shoulder, and beckoned them to enter. Mr.
Lorry got his arm securely round the daughter’s waist, and held her; for
he felt that she was sinking.
“A-a-a-business, business!” he urged, with a moisture that was not
of business shining on his cheek. “Come in, come in!”
“I am afraid of it,” she answered, shuddering.
“Of it? What?”
“I mean of him. Of my father.”
Rendered in a manner desperate, by her state and by the beckoning
of their conductor, he drew over his neck the arm that shook upon his
shoulder, lifted her a little, and hurried her into the room. He sat her
down just within the door, and held her, clinging to him.
Defarge drew out the key, closed the door, locked it on the inside,
took out the key again, and held it in his hand. All this he did, methodically, and with as loud and harsh an accompaniment of noise as he
could make. Finally, he walked across the room with a measured tread
to where the window was. He stopped there, and faced round.
The garret, built to be a depository for firewood and the like, was
dim and dark: for, the window of dormer shape, was in truth a door
in the roof, with a little crane over it for the hoisting up of stores from
the street: unglazed, and closing up the middle in two pieces, like any
other door of French construction. To exclude the cold, one half of
this door was fast closed, and the other was opened but a very little
way. Such a scanty portion of light was admitted through these means,
that it was difficult, on first coming in, to see anything; and long habit
alone could have slowly formed in any one, the ability to do any work
requiring nicety in such obscurity. Yet, work of that kind was being
done in the garret; for, with his back towards the door, and his face
towards the window where the keeper of the wine-shop stood looking
at him, a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and
very busy, making shoes.
34
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 6
The Shoemaker
“Good day!” said Monsieur Defarge, looking down at the white head
that bent low over the shoemaking.
It was raised for a moment, and a very faint voice responded to the
salutation, as if it were at a distance:
“Good day!”
“You are still hard at work, I see?”
After a long silence, the head was lifted for another moment, and
the voice replied, “Yes—I am working.” This time, a pair of haggard
eyes had looked at the questioner, before the face had dropped again.
The faintness of the voice was pitiable and dreadful. It was not the
faintness of physical weakness, though confinement and hard fare no
doubt had their part in it. Its deplorable peculiarity was, that it was
the faintness of solitude and disuse. It was like the last feeble echo of
a sound made long and long ago. So entirely had it lost the life and
resonance of the human voice, that it affected the senses like a once
beautiful colour faded away into a poor weak stain. So sunken and
suppressed it was, that it was like a voice underground. So expressive it
was, of a hopeless and lost creature, that a famished traveller, wearied
out by lonely wandering in a wilderness, would have remembered home
and friends in such a tone before lying down to die.
Some minutes of silent work had passed: and the haggard eyes had
looked up again: not with any interest or curiosity, but with a dull
mechanical perception, beforehand, that the spot where the only visitor
they were aware of had stood, was not yet empty.
“I want,” said Defarge, who had not removed his gaze from the shoemaker, “to let in a little more light here. You can bear a little more?”
The shoemaker stopped his work; looked with a vacant air of listening, at the floor on one side of him; then similarly, at the floor on the
other side of him; then, upward at the speaker.
“What did you say?”
“You can bear a little more light?”
“I must bear it, if you let it in.” (Laying the palest shadow of a stress
upon the second word.)
The opened half-door was opened a little further, and secured at
that angle for the time. A broad ray of light fell into the garret, and
35
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
showed the workman with an unfinished shoe upon his lap, pausing in
his labour. His few common tools and various scraps of leather were at
his feet and on his bench. He had a white beard, raggedly cut, but not
very long, a hollow face, and exceedingly bright eyes. The hollowness
and thinness of his face would have caused them to look large, under
his yet dark eyebrows and his confused white hair, though they had
been really otherwise; but, they were naturally large, and looked unnaturally so. His yellow rags of shirt lay open at the throat, and showed
his body to be withered and worn. He, and his old canvas frock, and
his loose stockings, and all his poor tatters of clothes, had, in a long
seclusion from direct light and air, faded down to such a dull uniformity of parchment-yellow, that it would have been hard to say which
was which.
He had put up a hand between his eyes and the light, and the very
bones of it seemed transparent. So he sat, with a steadfastly vacant gaze,
pausing in his work. He never looked at the figure before him, without
first looking down on this side of himself, then on that, as if he had lost
the habit of associating place with sound; he never spoke, without first
wandering in this manner, and forgetting to speak.
“Are you going to finish that pair of shoes to-day?” asked Defarge,
motioning to Mr. Lorry to come forward.
“What did you say?”
“Do you mean to finish that pair of shoes to-day?”
“I can’t say that I mean to. I suppose so. I don’t know.”
But, the question reminded him of his work, and he bent over it
again.
Mr. Lorry came silently forward, leaving the daughter by the door.
When he had stood, for a minute or two, by the side of Defarge, the
shoemaker looked up. He showed no surprise at seeing another figure,
but the unsteady fingers of one of his hands strayed to his lips as he
looked at it (his lips and his nails were of the same pale lead-colour),
and then the hand dropped to his work, and he once more bent over the
shoe. The look and the action had occupied but an instant.
“You have a visitor, you see,” said Monsieur Defarge.
“What did you say?”
“Here is a visitor.”
The shoemaker looked up as before, but without removing a hand
from his work.
“Come!” said Defarge. “Here is monsieur, who knows a well-made
36
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
shoe when he sees one. Show him that shoe you are working at. Take
it, monsieur.”
Mr. Lorry took it in his hand.
“Tell monsieur what kind of shoe it is, and the maker’s name.”
There was a longer pause than usual, before the shoemaker replied:
“I forget what it was you asked me. What did you say?”
“I said, couldn’t you describe the kind of shoe, for monsieur’s information?”
“It is a lady’s shoe. It is a young lady’s walking-shoe. It is in the
present mode. I never saw the mode. I have had a pattern in my hand.”
He glanced at the shoe with some little passing touch of pride.
“And the maker’s name?” said Defarge.
Now that he had no work to hold, he laid the knuckles of the right
hand in the hollow of the left, and then the knuckles of the left hand
in the hollow of the right, and then passed a hand across his bearded
chin, and so on in regular changes, without a moment’s intermission.
The task of recalling him from the vagrancy into which he always sank
when he had spoken, was like recalling some very weak person from
a swoon, or endeavouring, in the hope of some disclosure, to stay the
spirit of a fast-dying man.
“Did you ask me for my name?”
“Assuredly I did.”
“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”
“Is that all?”
“One Hundred and Five, North Tower.”
With a weary sound that was not a sigh, nor a groan, he bent to
work again, until the silence was again broken.
“You are not a shoemaker by trade?” said Mr. Lorry, looking steadfastly at him.
His haggard eyes turned to Defarge as if he would have transferred
the question to him: but as no help came from that quarter, they turned
back on the questioner when they had sought the ground.
“I am not a shoemaker by trade? No, I was not a shoemaker by
trade. I-I learnt it here. I taught myself. I asked leave to—”
He lapsed away, even for minutes, ringing those measured changes
on his hands the whole time. His eyes came slowly back, at last, to the
face from which they had wandered; when they rested on it, he started,
and resumed, in the manner of a sleeper that moment awake, reverting
to a subject of last night.
37
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I asked leave to teach myself, and I got it with much difficulty after
a long while, and I have made shoes ever since.”
As he held out his hand for the shoe that had been taken from him,
Mr. Lorry said, still looking steadfastly in his face:
“Monsieur Manette, do you remember nothing of me?”
The shoe dropped to the ground, and he sat looking fixedly at the
questioner.
“Monsieur Manette”; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge’s arm;
“do you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is
there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising
in your mind, Monsieur Manette?”
As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr.
Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent
intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves
through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded
again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And
so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her
who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and
where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been
only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and
shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him,
trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young
breast, and love it back to life and hope—so exactly was the expression
repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it
looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.
Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two,
less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the
ground and looked about him in the old way. Finally, with a deep long
sigh, he took the shoe up, and resumed his work.
“Have you recognised him, monsieur?” asked Defarge in a whisper.
“Yes; for a moment. At first I thought it quite hopeless, but I have
unquestionably seen, for a single moment, the face that I once knew so
well. Hush! Let us draw further back. Hush!”
She had moved from the wall of the garret, very near to the bench on
which he sat. There was something awful in his unconsciousness of the
figure that could have put out its hand and touched him as he stooped
over his labour.
Not a word was spoken, not a sound was made. She stood, like a
spirit, beside him, and he bent over his work.
38
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It happened, at length, that he had occasion to change the instrument
in his hand, for his shoemaker’s knife. It lay on that side of him which
was not the side on which she stood. He had taken it up, and was
stooping to work again, when his eyes caught the skirt of her dress. He
raised them, and saw her face. The two spectators started forward, but
she stayed them with a motion of her hand. She had no fear of his
striking at her with the knife, though they had.
He stared at her with a fearful look, and after a while his lips began
to form some words, though no sound proceeded from them. By degrees, in the pauses of his quick and laboured breathing, he was heard
to say:
“What is this?”
With the tears streaming down her face, she put her two hands to
her lips, and kissed them to him; then clasped them on her breast, as if
she laid his ruined head there.
“You are not the gaoler’s daughter?”
She sighed “No.”
“Who are you?”
Not yet trusting the tones of her voice, she sat down on the bench
beside him. He recoiled, but she laid her hand upon his arm. A strange
thrill struck him when she did so, and visibly passed over his frame; he
laid the knife down’ softly, as he sat staring at her.
Her golden hair, which she wore in long curls, had been hurriedly
pushed aside, and fell down over her neck. Advancing his hand by little
and little, he took it up and looked at it. In the midst of the action he
went astray, and, with another deep sigh, fell to work at his shoemaking.
But not for long. Releasing his arm, she laid her hand upon his
shoulder. After looking doubtfully at it, two or three times, as if to be
sure that it was really there, he laid down his work, put his hand to his
neck, and took off a blackened string with a scrap of folded rag attached
to it. He opened this, carefully, on his knee, and it contained a very little
quantity of hair: not more than one or two long golden hairs, which he
had, in some old day, wound off upon his finger.
He took her hair into his hand again, and looked closely at it. “It is
the same. How can it be! When was it! How was it!”
As the concentrated expression returned to his forehead, he seemed
to become conscious that it was in hers too. He turned her full to the
light, and looked at her.
“She had laid her head upon my shoulder, that night when I was
39
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
summoned out—she had a fear of my going, though I had none—and
when I was brought to the North Tower they found these upon my
sleeve. ’You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in
the body, though they may in the spirit.’ Those were the words I said. I
remember them very well.”
He formed this speech with his lips many times before he could utter it. But when he did find spoken words for it, they came to him
coherently, though slowly.
“How was this?—was it you?”
Once more, the two spectators started, as he turned upon her with
a frightful suddenness. But she sat perfectly still in his grasp, and only
said, in a low voice, “I entreat you, good gentlemen, do not come near
us, do not speak, do not move!”
“Hark!” he exclaimed. “Whose voice was that?”
His hands released her as he uttered this cry, and went up to his
white hair, which they tore in a frenzy. It died out, as everything but
his shoemaking did die out of him, and he refolded his little packet and
tried to secure it in his breast; but he still looked at her, and gloomily
shook his head.
“No, no, no; you are too young, too blooming. It can’t be. See what
the prisoner is. These are not the hands she knew, this is not the face
she knew, this is not a voice she ever heard. No, no. She was—and
He was—before the slow years of the North Tower—ages ago. What is
your name, my gentle angel?”
Hailing his softened tone and manner, his daughter fell upon her
knees before him, with her appealing hands upon his breast.
“O, sir, at another time you shall know my name, and who my
mother was, and who my father, and how I never knew their hard, hard
history. But I cannot tell you at this time, and I cannot tell you here. All
that I may tell you, here and now, is, that I pray to you to touch me and
to bless me. Kiss me, kiss me! O my dear, my dear!”
His cold white head mingled with her radiant hair, which warmed
and lighted it as though it were the light of Freedom shining on him.
“If you hear in my voice—I don’t know that it is so, but I hope it is—
if you hear in my voice any resemblance to a voice that once was sweet
music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, in touching
my hair, anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast
when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint
to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all
40
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance
of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for
it, weep for it!”
She held him closer round the neck, and rocked him on her breast
like a child.
“If, when I tell you, dearest dear, that your agony is over, and that I
have come here to take you from it, and that we go to England to be at
peace and at rest, I cause you to think of your useful life laid waste, and
of our native France so wicked to you, weep for it, weep for it! And if,
when I shall tell you of my name, and of my father who is living, and of
my mother who is dead, you learn that I have to kneel to my honoured
father, and implore his pardon for having never for his sake striven all
day and lain awake and wept all night, because the love of my poor
mother hid his torture from me, weep for it, weep for it! Weep for her,
then, and for me! Good gentlemen, thank God! I feel his sacred tears
upon my face, and his sobs strike against my heart. O, see! Thank God
for us, thank God!”
He had sunk in her arms, and his face dropped on her breast: a
sight so touching, yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong and suffering
which had gone before it, that the two beholders covered their faces.
When the quiet of the garret had been long undisturbed, and his
heaving breast and shaken form had long yielded to the calm that
must follow all storms—emblem to humanity, of the rest and silence
into which the storm called Life must hush at last—they came forward
to raise the father and daughter from the ground. He had gradually
dropped to the floor, and lay there in a lethargy, worn out. She had
nestled down with him, that his head might lie upon her arm; and her
hair drooping over him curtained him from the light.
“If, without disturbing him,” she said, raising her hand to Mr. Lorry
as he stooped over them, after repeated blowings of his nose, “all could
be arranged for our leaving Paris at once, so that, from the, very door,
he could be taken away—”
“But, consider. Is he fit for the journey?” asked Mr. Lorry.
“More fit for that, I think, than to remain in this city, so dreadful to
him.”
“It is true,” said Defarge, who was kneeling to look on and hear.
“More than that; Monsieur Manette is, for all reasons, best out of
France. Say, shall I hire a carriage and post-horses?”
“That’s business,” said Mr. Lorry, resuming on the shortest notice
41
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his methodical manners; “and if business is to be done, I had better do
it.”
“Then be so kind,” urged Miss Manette, “as to leave us here. You
see how composed he has become, and you cannot be afraid to leave
him with me now. Why should you be? If you will lock the door to
secure us from interruption, I do not doubt that you will find him, when
you come back, as quiet as you leave him. In any case, I will take care
of him until you return, and then we will remove him straight.”
Both Mr. Lorry and Defarge were rather disinclined to this course,
and in favour of one of them remaining. But, as there were not only
carriage and horses to be seen to, but travelling papers; and as time
pressed, for the day was drawing to an end, it came at last to their hastily
dividing the business that was necessary to be done, and hurrying away
to do it.
Then, as the darkness closed in, the daughter laid her head down
on the hard ground close at the father’s side, and watched him. The
darkness deepened and deepened, and they both lay quiet, until a light
gleamed through the chinks in the wall.
Mr. Lorry and Monsieur Defarge had made all ready for the journey, and had brought with them, besides travelling cloaks and wrappers, bread and meat, wine, and hot coffee. Monsieur Defarge put this
provender, and the lamp he carried, on the shoemaker’s bench (there
was nothing else in the garret but a pallet bed), and he and Mr. Lorry
roused the captive, and assisted him to his feet.
No human intelligence could have read the mysteries of his mind,
in the scared blank wonder of his face. Whether he knew what had
happened, whether he recollected what they had said to him, whether
he knew that he was free, were questions which no sagacity could have
solved. They tried speaking to him; but, he was so confused, and so very
slow to answer, that they took fright at his bewilderment, and agreed
for the time to tamper with him no more. He had a wild, lost manner of occasionally clasping his head in his hands, that had not been
seen in him before; yet, he had some pleasure in the mere sound of his
daughter’s voice, and invariably turned to it when she spoke.
In the submissive way of one long accustomed to obey under coercion, he ate and drank what they gave him to eat and drink, and put on
the cloak and other wrappings, that they gave him to wear. He readily
responded to his daughter’s drawing her arm through his, and took—
and kept—her hand in both his own.
42
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
They began to descend; Monsieur Defarge going first with the lamp,
Mr. Lorry closing the little procession. They had not traversed many
steps of the long main staircase when he stopped, and stared at the roof
and round at the wails.
“You remember the place, my father? You remember coming up
here?”
“What did you say?”
But, before she could repeat the question, he murmured an answer
as if she had repeated it.
“Remember? No, I don’t remember. It was so very long ago.”
That he had no recollection whatever of his having been brought
from his prison to that house, was apparent to them. They heard him
mutter, “One Hundred and Five, North Tower;” and when he looked
about him, it evidently was for the strong fortress-walls which had long
encompassed him. On their reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his tread, as being in expectation of a drawbridge; and when there
was no drawbridge, and he saw the carriage waiting in the open street,
he dropped his daughter’s hand and clasped his head again.
No crowd was about the door; no people were discernible at any of
the many windows; not even a chance passerby was in the street. An
unnatural silence and desertion reigned there. Only one soul was to be
seen, and that was Madame Defarge—who leaned against the door-post,
knitting, and saw nothing.
The prisoner had got into a coach, and his daughter had followed
him, when Mr. Lorry’s feet were arrested on the step by his asking, miserably, for his shoemaking tools and the unfinished shoes. Madame Defarge immediately called to her husband that she would get them, and
went, knitting, out of the lamplight, through the courtyard. She quickly
brought them down and handed them in;—and immediately afterwards
leaned against the door-post, knitting, and saw nothing.
Defarge got upon the box, and gave the word “To the Barrier!” The
postilion cracked his whip, and they clattered away under the feeble
over-swinging lamps.
Under the over-swinging lamps—swinging ever brighter in the better streets, and ever dimmer in the worse—and by lighted shops, gay
crowds, illuminated coffee-houses, and theatre-doors, to one of the city
gates. Soldiers with lanterns, at the guard-house there. “Your papers,
travellers!” “See here then, Monsieur the Officer,” said Defarge, getting
down, and taking him gravely apart, “these are the papers of monsieur
43
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
inside, with the white head. They were consigned to me, with him, at
the—” He dropped his voice, there was a flutter among the military
lanterns, and one of them being handed into the coach by an arm in
uniform, the eyes connected with the arm looked, not an every day or
an every night look, at monsieur with the white head. “It is well. Forward!” from the uniform. “Adieu!” from Defarge. And so, under a
short grove of feebler and feebler over-swinging lamps, out under the
great grove of stars.
Beneath that arch of unmoved and eternal lights; some, so remote
from this little earth that the learned tell us it is doubtful whether their
rays have even yet discovered it, as a point in space where anything
is suffered or done: the shadows of the night were broad and black.
All through the cold and restless interval, until dawn, they once more
whispered in the ears of Mr. Jarvis Lorry—sitting opposite the buried
man who had been dug out, and wondering what subtle powers were
for ever lost to him, and what were capable of restoration—the old
inquiry:
“I hope you care to be recalled to life?”
And the old answer:
“I can’t say.”

The Golden Thread
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 1
Five Years Later
Tellson’s Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the
year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very
dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place,
moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were
proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness,
proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction
that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This
was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more
convenient places of business. Tellson’s (they said) wanted no elbowroom, Tellson’s wanted no light, Tellson’s wanted no embellishment.
Noakes and Co.’s might, or Snooks Brothers’ might; but Tellson’s, thank
Heaven!—
Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the
question of rebuilding Tellson’s. In this respect the House was much
on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for
suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly
objectionable, but were only the more respectable.
Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson’s was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy
with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson’s down two steps,
and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind
rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows,
which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and
which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the
heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing
“the House,” you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the
back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came
with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the
dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old
wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your
throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty
odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was
stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communica46
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
tions corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into
extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted
all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your
lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room,
that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and
where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first
letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were
but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows,
by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.
But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue
with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson’s. Death
is Nature’s remedy for all things, and why not Legislation’s? Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to
Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner
of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse
at Tellson’s door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner
of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the
notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death. Not that it
did the least good in the way of prevention—it might almost have been
worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse—but, it cleared
off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after. Thus, Tellson’s, in its day,
like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many
lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple
Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have
excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant
manner.
Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson’s,
the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a
young man into Tellson’s London house, they hid him somewhere till
he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had
the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he
permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting
his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.
Outside Tellson’s—never by any means in it, unless called in—was
an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as
the live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours,
unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly
47
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that
Tellson’s, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had
always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had
drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the
youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness,
in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added
appellation of Jerry.
The scene was Mr. Cruncher’s private lodging in Hanging-swordalley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy
March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr.
Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from
the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name
upon it.)
Mr. Cruncher’s apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood,
and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass
in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early
as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed
was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers
arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white
cloth was spread.
Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a
Harlequin at home. At fast, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began
to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky
hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons. At which juncture,
he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:
“Bust me, if she ain’t at it agin!”
A woman of orderly and industrious appearance rose from her knees
in a corner, with sufficient haste and trepidation to show that she was
the person referred to.
“What!” said Mr. Cruncher, looking out of bed for a boot. “You’re
at it agin, are you?”
After hailing the mom with this second salutation, he threw a boot
at the woman as a third. It was a very muddy boot, and may introduce
the odd circumstance connected with Mr. Cruncher’s domestic economy,
that, whereas he often came home after banking hours with clean boots,
he often got up next morning to find the same boots covered with clay.
“What,” said Mr. Cruncher, varying his apostrophe after missing his
mark—“what are you up to, Aggerawayter?”
48
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I was only saying my prayers.”
“Saying your prayers! You’re a nice woman! What do you mean by
flopping yourself down and praying agin me?”
“I was not praying against you; I was praying for you.”
“You weren’t. And if you were, I won’t be took the liberty with.
Here! your mother’s a nice woman, young Jerry, going a praying agin
your father’s prosperity. You’ve got a dutiful mother, you have, my son.
You’ve got a religious mother, you have, my boy: going and flopping
herself down, and praying that the bread-and-butter may be snatched
out of the mouth of her only child.”
Master Cruncher (who was in his shirt) took this very ill, and, turning to his mother, strongly deprecated any praying away of his personal
board.
“And what do you suppose, you conceited female,” said Mr.
Cruncher, with unconscious inconsistency, “that the worth of your
prayers may be? Name the price that you put your prayers at!”
“They only come from the heart, Jerry. They are worth no more
than that.”
“Worth no more than that,” repeated Mr. Cruncher. “They ain’t
worth much, then. Whether or no, I won’t be prayed agin, I tell you. I
can’t afford it. I’m not a going to be made unlucky by your sneaking.
If you must go flopping yourself down, flop in favour of your husband
and child, and not in opposition to ’em. If I had had any but a unnat’ral
wife, and this poor boy had had any but a unnat’ral mother, I might
have made some money last week instead of being counter-prayed and
countermined and religiously circumwented into the worst of luck. B-uu-ust me!” said Mr. Cruncher, who all this time had been putting on his
clothes, “if I ain’t, what with piety and one blowed thing and another,
been choused this last week into as bad luck as ever a poor devil of a
honest tradesman met with! Young Jerry, dress yourself, my boy, and
while I clean my boots keep a eye upon your mother now and then, and
if you see any signs of more flopping, give me a call. For, I tell you,”
here he addressed his wife once more, “I won’t be gone agin, in this
manner. I am as rickety as a hackney-coach, I’m as sleepy as laudanum,
my lines is strained to that degree that I shouldn’t know, if it wasn’t
for the pain in ’em, which was me and which somebody else, yet I’m
none the better for it in pocket; and it’s my suspicion that you’ve been
at it from morning to night to prevent me from being the better for it in
pocket, and I won’t put up with it, Aggerawayter, and what do you say
49
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
now!”
Growling, in addition, such phrases as “Ah! yes! You’re religious,
too. You wouldn’t put yourself in opposition to the interests of your
husband and child, would you? Not you!” and throwing off other
sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr.
Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business. In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished
with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another,
as his father’s did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly
disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping
closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of “You are going to flop, mother. —Halloa, father!” and, after raising this fictitious
alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin.
Mr. Cruncher’s temper was not at all improved when he came to
his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher’s saying grace with particular
animosity.
“Now, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?”
His wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”
“Don’t do it!” said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife’s petitions.
“I ain’t a going to be blest out of house and home. I won’t have my
wittles blest off my table. Keep still!”
Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a
party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher
worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any fourfooted inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o’clock he smoothed his
ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day.
It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description
of himself as “a honest tradesman.” His stock consisted of a wooden
stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young
Jerry, walking at his father’s side, carried every morning to beneath the
banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the
addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any
passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man’s feet, it
formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher
was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself,—and
was almost as in-looking.
50
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Encamped at a quarter before nine, in good time to touch his threecornered hat to the oldest of men as they passed in to Tellson’s, Jerry
took up his station on this windy March morning, with young Jerry
standing by him, when not engaged in making forays through the Bar,
to inflict bodily and mental injuries of an acute description on passing
boys who were small enough for his amiable purpose. Father and son,
extremely like each other, looking silently on at the morning traffic in
Fleet-street, with their two heads as near to one another as the two eyes
of each were, bore a considerable resemblance to a pair of monkeys.
The resemblance was not lessened by the accidental circumstance, that
the mature Jerry bit and spat out straw, while the twinkling eyes of the
youthful Jerry were as restlessly watchful of him as of everything else in
Fleet-street.
The head of one of the regular indoor messengers attached to Tellson’s establishment was put through the door, and the word was given:
“Porter wanted!”
“Hooray, father! Here’s an early job to begin with!”
Having thus given his parent God speed, young Jerry seated himself
on the stool, entered on his reversionary interest in the straw his father
had been chewing, and cogitated.
“Al-ways rusty! His fingers is al-ways rusty!” muttered young Jerry.
“Where does my father get all that iron rust from? He don’t get no iron
rust here!”
Chapter 2
A Sight
“You know the Old Bailey, well, no doubt?” said one of the oldest of
clerks to Jerry the messenger.
“Ye-es, sir,” returned Jerry, in something of a dogged manner. “I do
know the Bailey.”
“Just so. And you know Mr. Lorry.”
“I know Mr. Lorry, sir, much better than I know the Bailey. Much
better,” said Jerry, not unlike a reluctant witness at the establishment in
question, “than I, as a honest tradesman, wish to know the Bailey.”
“Very well. Find the door where the witnesses go in, and show the
door-keeper this note for Mr. Lorry. He will then let you in.”
51
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Into the court, sir?”
“Into the court.”
Mr. Cruncher’s eyes seemed to get a little closer to one another, and
to interchange the inquiry, “What do you think of this?”
“Am I to wait in the court, sir?” he asked, as the result of that
conference.
“I am going to tell you. The door-keeper will pass the note to Mr.
Lorry, and do you make any gesture that will attract Mr. Lorry’s attention, and show him where you stand. Then what you have to do, is, to
remain there until he wants you.”
“Is that all, sir?”
“That’s all. He wishes to have a messenger at hand. This is to tell
him you are there.”
As the ancient clerk deliberately folded and superscribed the note,
Mr. Cruncher, after surveying him in silence until he came to the
blotting-paper stage, remarked:
“I suppose they’ll be trying Forgeries this morning?”
“Treason!”
“That’s quartering,” said Jerry. “Barbarous!”
“It is the law,” remarked the ancient clerk, turning his surprised
spectacles upon him. “It is the law.”
“It’s hard in the law to spile a man, I think. Ifs hard enough to kill
him, but it’s wery hard to spile him, sir.”
“Not at all,” retained the ancient clerk. “Speak well of the law. Take
care of your chest and voice, my good friend, and leave the law to take
care of itself. I give you that advice.”
“It’s the damp, sir, what settles on my chest and voice,” said Jerry.
“I leave you to judge what a damp way of earning a living mine is.”
“Well, well,” said the old clerk; “we all have our various ways of
gaining a livelihood. Some of us have damp ways, and some of us have
dry ways. Here is the letter. Go along.”
Jerry took the letter, and, remarking to himself with less internal
deference than he made an outward show of, “You are a lean old one,
too,” made his bow, informed his son, in passing, of his destination, and
went his way.
They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate
had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it.
But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and
villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came
52
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the
dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench.
It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner’s, and even died
before him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly
inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and
coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two
miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the
beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution,
that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent;
also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions
in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically
leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed
under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice
illustration of the precept, that “Whatever is is right;” an aphorism that
would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.
Making his way through the tainted crowd, dispersed up and down
this hideous scene of action, with the skill of a man accustomed to
make his way quietly, the messenger found out the door he sought, and
handed in his letter through a trap in it. For, people then paid to see
the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam—
only the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the
Old Bailey doors were well guarded—except, indeed, the social doors
by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.
After some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its
hinges a very little way, and allowed Mr. Jerry Cruncher to squeeze
himself into court.
“What’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself
next to.
“Nothing yet.”
“What’s coming on?”
“The Treason case.”
“The quartering one, eh?”
“Ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle
to be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his
own face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks
53
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
on, and then his head will be chopped off, and he’ll be cut into quarters.
That’s the sentence.”
“If he’s found Guilty, you mean to say?” Jerry added, by way of
proviso.
“Oh! they’ll find him guilty,” said the other. “Don’t you be afraid
of that.”
Mr. Cruncher’s attention was here diverted to the door-keeper,
whom he saw making his way to Mr. Lorry, with the note in his hand.
Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from
a wigged gentleman, the prisoner’s counsel, who had a great bundle of
papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with
his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher
looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court. After some gruff coughing and rubbing of his chin and
signing with his hand, Jerry attracted the notice of Mr. Lorry, who had
stood up to look for him, and who quietly nodded and sat down again.
“What’s he got to do with the case?” asked the man he had spoken
with.
“Blest if I know,” said Jerry.
“What have you got to do with it, then, if a person may inquire?”
“Blest if I know that either,” said Jerry.
The entrance of the Judge, and a consequent great stir and settling
down in the court, stopped the dialogue. Presently, the dock became
the central point of interest. Two gaolers, who had been standing there,
wont out, and the prisoner was brought in, and put to the bar.
Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at
the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at
him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round pillars
and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up,
not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their
hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves,
at anybody’s cost, to a view of him—stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges,
stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous
among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate,
Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had
taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves
of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed
at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an
impure mist and rain.

A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about
five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek
and a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He
was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was
long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more
to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind
will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness
which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek,
showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite
self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.
The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed
at, was not a sort that elevated humanity. Had he stood in peril of a
less horrible sentence—had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared—by just so much would he have lost in his fascination. The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and
torn asunder, yielded the sensation. Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of
self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.
Silence in the court! Charles Darnay had yesterday pleaded Not
Guilty to an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle)
for that he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth, prince, our Lord the King, by reason of his having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted Lewis, the French
King, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions
of our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, and those of the
said French Lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said French Lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation to
send to Canada and North America. This much, Jerry, with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out
with huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding
that the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, Charles Darnay,
stood there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in;
and that Mr. Attorney-General was making ready to speak.
The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally
hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched
from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. He was quiet
55
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which
it was strewn. The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with
vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.
Over the prisoner’s head there was a mirror, to throw the light down
upon him. Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected
in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth’s together. Haunted
in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if
the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is
one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and
disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner’s
mind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious
of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass
his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.
It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court
which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that
corner of the Judge’s bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect,
that all the eyes that were tamed upon him, turned to them.
The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more
than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a
very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his
hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind,
but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon
him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken
up—as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter—he
became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.
His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she
sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him,
in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead
had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion
that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very
noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who
had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went
about, “Who are they?”
Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his
own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his
absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about
56
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and
from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got
to Jerry:
“Witnesses.”
“For which side?”
“Against.”
“Against what side?”
“The prisoner’s.”
The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled
them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life
was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind
the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.
Chapter 3
A Disappointment
Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before
them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which
claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public
enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of
last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had,
for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between
France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account. That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive
(which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered. That Providence, however, had
put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner’s schemes, and, struck
with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty’s Chief Secretary of State
and most honourable Privy Council. That, this patriot would be produced before them. That, his position and attitude were, on the whole,
sublime. That, he had been the prisoner’s friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate
the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar
of his country. That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient
Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one. That, as they were not so decreed, he probably
57
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
would not have one. That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in
many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word,
at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury’s countenances displayed
a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was
in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country. That, the lofty example of this immaculate
and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however
unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner’s servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his
master’s table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers. That, he (Mr.
Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted
of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him
to his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) brothers and sisters, and honoured him
more than his (Mr. Attorney-General’s) father and mother. That, he
called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise. That, the
evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their
discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have
been furnished with lists of his Majesty’s forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt
that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.
That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner’s handwriting;
but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for
the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.
That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner
already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before
the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and
the Americans. That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as
he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as they knew they
were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him,
whether they liked it or not. That, they never could lay their heads upon
their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the
notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short,
that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads
upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner’s head was taken off. That head
Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of
everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of
his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good
as dead and gone.
58
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if
a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become. When toned down again, the
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.
Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader’s lead, examined the
patriot: John Barsad, gentleman, by name. The story of his pure soul
was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be—perhaps,
if it had a fault, a little too exactly. Having released his noble bosom
of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the
wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr.
Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions. The wigged gentleman sitting
opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.
Had he ever been a spy himself? No, he scorned the base insinuation. What did he live upon? His property. Where was his property?
He didn’t precisely remember where it was. What was it? No business
of anybody’s. Had he inherited it? Yes, he had. From whom? Distant relation. Very distant? Rather. Ever been in prison? Certainly
not. Never in a debtors’ prison? Didn’t see what that had to do with
it. Never in a debtors’ prison?—Come, once again. Never? Yes. How
many times? Two or three times. Not five or six? Perhaps. Of what profession? Gentleman. Ever been kicked? Might have been. Frequently?
No. Ever kicked downstairs? Decidedly not; once received a kick on
the top of a staircase, and fell downstairs of his own accord. Kicked
on that occasion for cheating at dice? Something to that effect was said
by the intoxicated liar who committed the assault, but it was not true.
Swear it was not true? Positively. Ever live by cheating at play? Never.
Ever live by play? Not more than other gentlemen do. Ever borrow
money of the prisoner? Yes. Ever pay him? No. Was not this intimacy
with the prisoner, in reality a very slight one, forced upon the prisoner
in coaches, inns, and packets? No. Sure he saw the prisoner with these
lists? Certain. Knew no more about the lists? No. Had not procured
them himself, for instance? No. Expect to get anything by this evidence?
No. Not in regular government pay and employment, to lay traps? Oh
dear no. Or to do anything? Oh dear no. Swear that? Over and over
again. No motives but motives of sheer patriotism? None whatever.
The virtuous servant, Roger Cly, swore his way through the case at
a great rate. He had taken service with the prisoner, in good faith and
simplicity, four years ago. He had asked the prisoner, aboard the Calais
packet, if he wanted a handy fellow, and the prisoner had engaged him.
59
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He had not asked the prisoner to take the handy fellow as an act of
charity—never thought of such a thing. He began to have suspicions
of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these
in the prisoner’s pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists
from the drawer of the prisoner’s desk. He had not put them there
first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais
and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn’t bear it, and had given
information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot;
he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be
only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years;
that was merely a coincidence. He didn’t call it a particularly curious
coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a
curious coincidence that true patriotism was his only motive too. He
was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.
The blue-flies buzzed again, and Mr. Attorney-General called Mr.
Jarvis Lorry.
“Mr. Jarvis Lorry, are you a clerk in Tellson’s bank?”
“I am.”
“On a certain Friday night in November one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, did business occasion you to travel between London and Dover by the mail?”
“It did.”
“Were there any other passengers in the mail?”
“Two.”
“Did they alight on the road in the course of the night?”
“They did.”
“Mr. Lorry, look upon the prisoner. Was he one of those two passengers?”
“I cannot undertake to say that he was.”
“Does he resemble either of these two passengers?”
“Both were so wrapped up, and the night was so dark, and we were
all so reserved, that I cannot undertake to say even that.”
“Mr. Lorry, look again upon the prisoner. Supposing him wrapped
up as those two passengers were, is there anything in his bulk and
stature to render it unlikely that he was one of them?”
“No.”
“You will not swear, Mr. Lorry, that he was not one of them?”
60
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“No.”
“So at least you say he may have been one of them?”
“Yes. Except that I remember them both to have been—like myself—
timorous of highwaymen, and the prisoner has not a timorous air.”
“Did you ever see a counterfeit of timidity, Mr. Lorry?”
“I certainly have seen that.”
“Mr. Lorry, look once more upon the prisoner. Have you seen him,
to your certain knowledge, before?”
“I have.”
“When?”
“I was returning from France a few days afterwards, and, at Calais,
the prisoner came on board the packet-ship in which I returned, and
made the voyage with me.”
“At what hour did he come on board?”
“At a little after midnight.”
“In the dead of the night. Was he the only passenger who came on
board at that untimely hour?”
“He happened to be the only one.”
“Never mind about ‘happening,’ Mr. Lorry. He was the only passenger who came on board in the dead of the night?”
“He was.”
“Were you travelling alone, Mr. Lorry, or with any companion?”
“With two companions. A gentleman and lady. They are here.”
“They are here. Had you any conversation with the prisoner?”
“Hardly any. The weather was stormy, and the passage long and
rough, and I lay on a sofa, almost from shore to shore.”
“Miss Manette!”
The young lady, to whom all eyes had been turned before, and were
now turned again, stood up where she had sat. Her father rose with her,
and kept her hand drawn through his arm.
“Miss Manette, look upon the prisoner.”
To be confronted with such pity, and such earnest youth and beauty,
was far more trying to the accused than to be confronted with all the
crowd. Standing, as it were, apart with her on the edge of his grave, not
all the staring curiosity that looked on, could, for the moment, nerve
him to remain quite still. His hurried right hand parcelled out the herbs
before him into imaginary beds of flowers in a garden; and his efforts to
control and steady his breathing shook the lips from which the colour
rushed to his heart. The buzz of the great flies was loud again.
61
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Miss Manette, have you seen the prisoner before?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Where?”
“On board of the packet-ship just now referred to, sir, and on the
same occasion.”
“You are the young lady just now referred to?”
“O! most unhappily, I am!”
The plaintive tone of her compassion merged into the less musical
voice of the Judge, as he said something fiercely: “Answer the questions
put to you, and make no remark upon them.”
“Miss Manette, had you any conversation with the prisoner on that
passage across the Channel?”
“Yes, sir.”
“Recall it.”
In the midst of a profound stillness, she faintly began: “When the
gentleman came on board—”
“Do you mean the prisoner?” inquired the Judge, knitting his brows.
“Yes, my Lord.”
“Then say the prisoner.”
“When the prisoner came on board, he noticed that my father,” turning her eyes lovingly to him as he stood beside her, “was much fatigued
and in a very weak state of health. My father was so reduced that I was
afraid to take him out of the air, and I had made a bed for him on the
deck near the cabin steps, and I sat on the deck at his side to take care of
him. There were no other passengers that night, but we four. The prisoner was so good as to beg permission to advise me how I could shelter
my father from the wind and weather, better than I had done. I had not
known how to do it well, not understanding how the wind would set
when we were out of the harbour. He did it for me. He expressed great
gentleness and kindness for my father’s state, and I am sure he felt it.
That was the manner of our beginning to speak together.”
“Let me interrupt you for a moment. Had he come on board alone?”
“No.”
“How many were with him?”
“Two French gentlemen.”
“Had they conferred together?”
“They had conferred together until the last moment, when it was
necessary for the French gentlemen to be landed in their boat.”
“Had any papers been handed about among them, similar to these
62
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
lists?”
“Some papers had been handed about among them, but I don’t know
what papers.”
“Like these in shape and size?”
“Possibly, but indeed I don’t know, although they stood whispering
very near to me: because they stood at the top of the cabin steps to have
the light of the lamp that was hanging there; it was a dull lamp, and
they spoke very low, and I did not hear what they said, and saw only
that they looked at papers.”
“Now, to the prisoner’s conversation, Miss Manette.”
“The prisoner was as open in his confidence with me—which arose
out of my helpless situation—as he was kind, and good, and useful to
my father. I hope,” bursting into tears, “I may not repay him by doing
him harm to-day.”
Buzzing from the blue-flies.
“Miss Manette, if the prisoner does not perfectly understand that
you give the evidence which it is your duty to give—which you must
give—and which you cannot escape from giving—with great unwillingness, he is the only person present in that condition. Please to go on.”
“He told me that he was travelling on business of a delicate and
difficult nature, which might get people into trouble, and that he was
therefore travelling under an assumed name. He said that this business
had, within a few days, taken him to France, and might, at intervals,
take him backwards and forwards between France and England for a
long time to come.”
“Did he say anything about America, Miss Manette? Be particular.”
“He tried to explain to me how that quarrel had arisen, and he
said that, so far as he could judge, it was a wrong and foolish one
on England’s part. He added, in a jesting way, that perhaps George
Washington might gain almost as great a name in history as George the
Third. But there was no harm in his way of saying this: it was said
laughingly, and to beguile the time.”
Any strongly marked expression of face on the part of a chief actor
in a scene of great interest to whom many eyes are directed, will be
unconsciously imitated by the spectators. Her forehead was painfully
anxious and intent as she gave this evidence, and, in the pauses when
she stopped for the Judge to write it down, watched its effect upon
the counsel for and against. Among the lookers-on there was the same
expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority
63
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness,
when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous
heresy about George Washington.
Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it
necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady’s
father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly.
“Doctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him
before?”
“Once. When he caged at my lodgings in London. Some three years,
or three years and a half ago.”
“Can you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet,
or speak to his conversation with your daughter?”
“Sir, I can do neither.”
“Is there any particular and special reason for your being unable to
do either?”
He answered, in a low voice, “There is.”
“Has it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?”
He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, “A long imprisonment.”
“Were you newly released on the occasion in question?”
“They tell me so.”
“Have you no remembrance of the occasion?”
“None. My mind is a blank, from some time—I cannot even say
what time—when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes,
to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter
here. She had become familiar to me, when a gracious God restored
my faculties; but, I am quite unable even to say how she had become
familiar. I have no remembrance of the process.”
Mr. Attorney-General sat down, and the father and daughter sat
down together.
A singular circumstance then arose in the case. The object in hand
being to show that the prisoner went down, with some fellow-plotter untracked, in the Dover mail on that Friday night in November five years
ago, and got out of the mail in the night, as a blind, at a place where
he did not remain, but from which he travelled back some dozen miles
or more, to a garrison and dockyard, and there collected information;
a witness was called to identify him as having been at the precise time
required, in the coffee-room of an hotel in that garrison-and-dockyard
64
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
town, waiting for another person. The prisoner’s counsel was crossexamining this witness with no result, except that he had never seen the
prisoner on any other occasion, when the wigged gentleman who had
all this time been looking at the ceiling of the court, wrote a word or
two on a little piece of paper, screwed it up, and tossed it to him. Opening this piece of paper in the next pause, the counsel looked with great
attention and curiosity at the prisoner.
“You say again you are quite sure that it was the prisoner?”
The witness was quite sure.
“Did you ever see anybody very like the prisoner?”
Not so like (the witness said) as that he could be mistaken.
“Look well upon that gentleman, my learned friend there,” pointing
to him who had tossed the paper over, “and then look well upon the
prisoner. How say you? Are they very like each other?”
Allowing for my learned friend’s appearance being careless and
slovenly if not debauched, they were sufficiently like each other to surprise, not only the witness, but everybody present, when they were thus
brought into comparison. My Lord being prayed to bid my learned
friend lay aside his wig, and giving no very gracious consent, the likeness became much more remarkable. My Lord inquired of Mr. Stryver
(the prisoner’s counsel), whether they were next to try Mr. Carton (name
of my learned friend) for treason? But, Mr. Stryver replied to my Lord,
no; but he would ask the witness to tell him whether what happened
once, might happen twice; whether he would have been so confident if
he had seen this illustration of his rashness sooner, whether he would
be so confident, having seen it; and more. The upshot of which, was, to
smash this witness like a crockery vessel, and shiver his part of the case
to useless lumber.
Mr. Cruncher had by this time taken quite a lunch of rust off his
fingers in his following of the evidence. He had now to attend while
Mr. Stryver fitted the prisoner’s case on the jury, like a compact suit
of clothes; showing them how the patriot, Barsad, was a hired spy
and traitor, an unblushing trafficker in blood, and one of the greatest
scoundrels upon earth since accursed Judas—which he certainly did
look rather like. How the virtuous servant, Cly, was his friend and
partner, and was worthy to be; how the watchful eyes of those forgers
and false swearers had rested on the prisoner as a victim, because some
family affairs in France, he being of French extraction, did require his
making those passages across the Channel—though what those affairs
65
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
were, a consideration for others who were near and dear to him, forbade him, even for his life, to disclose. How the evidence that had been
warped and wrested from the young lady, whose anguish in giving it
they had witnessed, came to nothing, involving the mere little innocent
gallantries and politenesses likely to pass between any young gentleman
and young lady so thrown together;—with the exception of that reference to George Washington, which was altogether too extravagant and
impossible to be regarded in any other light than as a monstrous joke.
How it would be a weakness in the government to break down in this
attempt to practise for popularity on the lowest national antipathies and
fears, and therefore Mr. Attorney-General had made the most of it; how,
nevertheless, it rested upon nothing, save that vile and infamous character of evidence too often disfiguring such cases, and of which the State
Trials of this country were full. But, there my Lord interposed (with as
grave a face as if it had not been true), saying that he could not sit upon
that Bench and suffer those allusions.
Mr. Stryver then called his few witnesses, and Mr. Cruncher had next
to attend while Mr. Attorney-General turned the whole suit of clothes
Mr. Stryver had fitted on the jury, inside out; showing how Barsad and
Cly were even a hundred times better than he had thought them, and the
prisoner a hundred times worse. Lastly, came my Lord himself, turning
the suit of clothes, now inside out, now outside in, but on the whole decidedly trimming and shaping them into grave-clothes for the prisoner.
And now, the jury turned to consider, and the great flies swarmed
again.
Mr. Carton, who had so long sat looking at the ceiling of the court,
changed neither his place nor his attitude, even in this excitement. While
his teamed friend, Mr. Stryver, massing his papers before him, whispered with those who sat near, and from time to time glanced anxiously
at the jury; while all the spectators moved more or less, and grouped
themselves anew; while even my Lord himself arose from his seat, and
slowly paced up and down his platform, not unattended by a suspicion
in the minds of the audience that his state was feverish; this one man sat
leaning back, with his torn gown half off him, his untidy wig put on just
as it had happened to fight on his head after its removal, his hands in his
pockets, and his eyes on the ceiling as they had been all day. Something
especially reckless in his demeanour, not only gave him a disreputable
look, but so diminished the strong resemblance he undoubtedly bore to
the prisoner (which his momentary earnestness, when they were com66
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
pared together, had strengthened), that many of the lookers-on, taking
note of him now, said to one another they would hardly have thought
the two were so alike. Mr. Cruncher made the observation to his next
neighbour, and added, “I’d hold half a guinea that he don’t get no lawwork to do. Don’t look like the sort of one to get any, do he?”
Yet, this Mr. Carton took in more of the details of the scene than he
appeared to take in; for now, when Miss Manette’s head dropped upon
her father’s breast, he was the first to see it, and to say audibly: “Officer!
look to that young lady. Help the gentleman to take her out. Don’t you
see she will fall!”
There was much commiseration for her as she was removed, and
much sympathy with her father. It had evidently been a great distress
to him, to have the days of his imprisonment recalled. He had shown
strong internal agitation when he was questioned, and that pondering
or brooding look which made him old, had been upon him, like a heavy
cloud, ever since. As he passed out, the jury, who had turned back and
paused a moment, spoke, through their foreman.
They were not agreed, and wished to retire. My Lord (perhaps with
George Washington on his mind) showed some surprise that they were
not agreed, but signified his pleasure that they should retire under watch
and ward, and retired himself. The trial had lasted all day, and the
lamps in the court were now being lighted. It began to be rumoured
that the jury would be out a long while. The spectators dropped off to
get refreshment, and the prisoner withdrew to the back of the dock, and
sat down.
Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father
went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him.
“Jerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in
the way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don’t be a
moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the
bank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple
Bar long before I can.”
Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in
acknowedgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came
up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm.
“How is the young lady?”
“She is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she
feels the better for being out of court.”

“I’ll tell the prisoner so. It won’t do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.”
Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the
point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the
bar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him,
all eyes, ears, and spikes.
“Mr. Darnay!”
The prisoner came forward directly.
“You will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette.
She will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.”
“I am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her
so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?”
“Yes, I could. I will, if you ask it.”
Mr. Carton’s manner was so careless as to be almost insolent. He
stood, half turned from the prisoner, lounging with his elbow against
the bar.
“I do ask it. Accept my cordial thanks.”
“What,” said Carton, still only half turned towards him, “do you
expect, Mr. Darnay?”
“The worst.”
“It’s the wisest thing to expect, and the likeliest. But I think their
withdrawing is in your favour.”
Loitering on the way out of court not being allowed, Jerry heard no
more: but left them—so like each other in feature, so unlike each other
in manner—standing side by side, both reflected in the glass above them.
An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal
crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and
ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking
that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a
rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried
him along with them.
“Jerry! Jerry!” Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he
got there.
“Here, sir! It’s a fight to get back again. Here I am, sir!”
Mr. Lorry handed him a paper through the throng. “Quick! Have
you got it?”
“Yes, sir.”
Hastily written on the paper was the word “aquitted.”
“If you had sent the message, ‘Recalled to Life,’ again,” muttered
68
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Jerry, as he turned, “I should have known what you meant, this time.”
He had no opportunity of saying, or so much as thinking, anything
else, until he was clear of the Old Bailey; for, the crowd came pouring
out with a vehemence that nearly took him off his legs, and a loud buzz
swept into the street as if the baffled blue-flies were dispersing in search
of other carrion.
Chapter 4
Congratulatory
From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr.
Charles Darnay—just released—congratulating him on his escape from
death.
It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in
Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice,
without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had
not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to
the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering
agony, would always—as on the trial—evoke this condition from the
depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw
a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his
story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon
him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles
away.
Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding
from his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past
beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound
of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong
beneficial influence with him almost always. Not absolutely always, for
she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they
were few and slight, and she believed them over.
69
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had
turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of
little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout,
loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing
way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and
conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life.
He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at
his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry
clean out of the group: “I am glad to have brought you off with honour,
Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not
the less likely to succeed on that account.”
“You have laid me under an obligation to you for life—in two
senses,” said his late client, taking his hand.
“I have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good
as another man’s, I believe.”
It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, “Much better,” Mr.
Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested
object of squeezing himself back again.
“You think so?” said Mr. Stryver. “Well! you have been present all
day, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.”
“And as such,” quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the
law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously
shouldered him out of it—“as such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to
break up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie
looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.”
“Speak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver; “I have a night’s work
to do yet. Speak for yourself.”
“I speak for myself,” answered Mr. Lorry, “and for Mr. Darnay, and
for Miss Lucie, and—Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us
all?” He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her
father.
His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at
Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust,
not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his
thoughts had wandered away.
“My father,” said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his.
He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her.
“Shall we go home, my father?”
With a long breath, he answered “Yes.”
70
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the
impression—which he himself had originated—that he would not be
released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the
dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning’s interest of gallows,
pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking
between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open
air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed
in it.
Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back
to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group,
or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled
out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He
now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the
pavement.
“So, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?”
Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton’s part in the
day’s proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was
none the better for it in appearance.
“If you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the
business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business
appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.”
Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, “You have mentioned that
before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own
masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.”
“I know, I know,” rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. “Don’t be nettled,
Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare
say.”
“And indeed, sir,” pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, “I really
don’t know what you have to do with the matter. If you’ll excuse me, as
very much your elder, for saying so, I really don’t know that it is your
business.”
“Business! Bless you, I have no business,” said Mr. Carton.
“It is a pity you have not, sir.”
“I think so, too.”
“If you had,” pursued Mr. Lorry, “perhaps you would attend to it.”
“Lord love you, no!—I shouldn’t,” said Mr. Carton.
“Well, sir!” cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference,
71
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“business is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir,
if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr.
Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you,
sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy
life.—Chair there!”
Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr.
Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson’s. Carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to Darnay:
“This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This
must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?”
“I hardly seem yet,” returned Charles Darnay, “to belong to this
world again.”
“I don’t wonder at it; it’s not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.”
“I begin to think I am faint.”
“Then why the devil don’t you dine? I dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to—this,
or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.”
Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill
to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were
shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat
opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before
him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.
“Do you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again,
Mr. Darnay?”
“I am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far
mended as to feel that.”
“It must be an immense satisfaction!”
He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large
one.
“As to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it.
It has no good in it for me—except wine like this—nor I for it. So we
are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not
much alike in any particular, you and I.”
Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
72
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay
was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.
“Now your dinner is done,” Carton presently said, “why don’t you
call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don’t you give your toast?”
“What health? What toast?”
“Why, it’s on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I’ll
swear it’s there.”
“Miss Manette, then!”
“Miss Manette, then!”
Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered
to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another.
“That’s a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!” he said, ruing his new goblet.
A slight frown and a laconic “Yes,” were the answer.
“That’s a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does
it feel? Is it worth being tried for one’s life, to be the object of such
sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?”
Again Darnay answered not a word.
“She was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her.
Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.”
The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of
the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it.
“I neither want any thanks, nor merit any,” was the careless rejoinder. “It was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don’t know why I did
it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.”
“Willingly, and a small return for your good offices.”
“Do you think I particularly like you?”
“Really, Mr. Carton,” returned the other, oddly disconcerted, “I
have not asked myself the question.”
“But ask yourself the question now.”
“You have acted as if you do; but I don’t think you do.”
“I don’t think I do,” said Carton. “I begin to have a very good
opinion of your understanding.”
“Nevertheless,” pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, “there is
nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side.”
Carton rejoining, “Nothing in life!” Darnay rang. “Do you call the
73
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
whole reckoning?” said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative,
“Then bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and
wake me at ten.”
The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.
Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner, and said, “A last word, Mr. Darnay: you think
I am drunk?”
“I think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.”
“Think? You know I have been drinking.”
“Since I must say so, I know it.”
“Then you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir.
I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.”
“Much to be regretted. You might have used your talents better.”
“May be so, Mr. Darnay; may be not. Don’t let your sober face elate
you, however; you don’t know what it may come to. Good night!”
When he was left alone, this strange being took up a candle, went to
a glass that hung against the wall, and surveyed himself minutely in it.
“Do you particularly like the man?” he muttered, at his own image;
“why should you particularly like a man who resembles you? There is
nothing in you to like; you know that. Ah, confound you! What a
change you have made in yourself! A good reason for taking to a man,
that he shows you what you have fallen away from, and what you might
have been! Change places with him, and would you have been looked
at by those blue eyes as he was, and commiserated by that agitated face
as he was? Come on, and have it out in plain words! You hate the
fellow.”
He resorted to his pint of wine for consolation, drank it all in a few
minutes, and fell asleep on his arms, with his hair straggling over the
table, and a long winding-sheet in the candle dripping down upon him.
Chapter 5
The Jackal
Those were drinking days, and most men drank hard. So very great is
the improvement Time has brought about in such habits, that a moderate statement of the quantity of wine and punch which one man would
swallow in the course of a night, without any detriment to his reputation
74
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
as a perfect gentleman, would seem, in these days, a ridiculous exaggeration. The learned profession of the law was certainly not behind any
other learned profession in its Bacchanalian propensities; neither was
Mr. Stryver, already fast shouldering his way to a large and lucrative
practice, behind his compeers in this particular, any more than in the
drier parts of the legal race.
A favourite at the Old Bailey, and eke at the Sessions, Mr. Stryver
had begun cautiously to hew away the lower staves of the ladder on
which he mounted. Sessions and Old Bailey had now to summon their
favourite, specially, to their longing arms; and shouldering itself towards the visage of the Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King’s Bench,
the florid countenance of Mr. Stryver might be daily seen, bursting out
of the bed of wigs, like a great sunflower pushing its way at the sun
from among a rank garden-full of flaring companions.
It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib
man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among
the most striking and necessary of the advocate’s accomplishments. But,
a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith
and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney
Carton, he always had his points at his fingers’ ends in the morning.
Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver’s
great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and
Michaelmas, might have floated a king’s ship. Stryver never had a case
in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets,
staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even
there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton
was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat. At last, it began to get
about, among such as were interested in the matter, that although Sydney Carton would never be a lion, he was an amazingly good jackal,
and that he rendered suit and service to Stryver in that humble capacity.
“Ten o’clock, sir,” said the man at the tavern, whom he had charged
to wake him—“ten o’clock, sir.”
“What’s the matter?”
“Ten o’clock, sir.”
“What do you mean? Ten o’clock at night?”
“Yes, sir. Your honour told me to call you.”
75
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Oh! I remember. Very well, very well.”
After a few dull efforts to get to sleep again, which the man dexterously combated by stirring the fire continuously for five minutes, he
got up, tossed his hat on, and walked out. He turned into the Temple,
and, having revived himself by twice pacing the pavements of King’s
Bench-walk and Paper-buildings, turned into the Stryver chambers.
The Stryver clerk, who never assisted at these conferences, had gone
home, and the Stryver principal opened the door. He had his slippers
on, and a loose bed-gown, and his throat was bare for his greater ease.
He had that rather wild, strained, seared marking about the eyes, which
may be observed in all free livers of his class, from the portrait of Jeffries
downward, and which can be traced, under various disguises of Art,
through the portraits of every Drinking Age.
“You are a little late, Memory,” said Stryver.
“About the usual time; it may be a quarter of an hour later.”
They went into a dingy room lined with books and littered with
papers, where there was a blazing fire. A kettle steamed upon the hob,
and in the midst of the wreck of papers a table shone, with plenty of
wine upon it, and brandy, and rum, and sugar, and lemons.
“You have had your bottle, I perceive, Sydney.”
“Two to-night, I think. I have been dining with the day’s client; or
seeing him dine—it’s all one!”
“That was a rare point, Sydney, that you brought to bear upon the
identification. How did you come by it? When did it strike you?”
“I thought he was rather a handsome fellow, and I thought I should
have been much the same sort of fellow, if I had had any luck.”
Mr. Stryver laughed till he shook his precocious paunch.
“You and your luck, Sydney! Get to work, get to work.”
Sullenly enough, the jackal loosened his dress, went into an adjoining room, and came back with a large jug of cold water, a basin, and a
towel or two. Steeping the towels in the water, and partially wringing
them out, he folded them on his head in a manner hideous to behold,
sat down at the table, and said, “Now I am ready!”
“Not much boiling down to be done to-night, Memory,” said Mr.
Stryver, gaily, as he looked among his papers.
“How much?”
“Only two sets of them.”
“Give me the worst first.”
“There they are, Sydney. Fire away!”
76
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The lion then composed himself on his back on a sofa on one side of
the drinking-table, while the jackal sat at his own paper-bestrewn table
proper, on the other side of it, with the bottles and glasses ready to his
hand. Both resorted to the drinking-table without stint, but each in a
different way; the lion for the most part reclining with his hands in his
waistband, looking at the fire, or occasionally flirting with some lighter
document; the jackal, with knitted brows and intent face, so deep in
his task, that his eyes did not even follow the hand he stretched out
for his glass—which often groped about, for a minute or more, before
it found the glass for his lips. Two or three times, the matter in hand
became so knotty, that the jackal found it imperative on him to get up,
and steep his towels anew. From these pilgrimages to the jug and basin,
he returned with such eccentricities of damp headgear as no words can
describe; which were made the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity.
At length the jackal had got together a compact repast for the lion,
and proceeded to offer it to him. The lion took it with care and caution,
made his selections from it, and his remarks upon it, and the jackal
assisted both. When the repast was fully discussed, the lion put his
hands in his waistband again, and lay down to mediate. The jackal then
invigorated himself with a bum for his throttle, and a fresh application
to his head, and applied himself to the collection of a second meal; this
was administered to the lion in the same manner, and was not disposed
of until the clocks struck three in the morning.
“And now we have done, Sydney, fill a bumper of punch,” said Mr.
Stryver.
The jackal removed the towels from his head, which had been steaming again, shook himself, yawned, shivered, and complied.
“You were very sound, Sydney, in the matter of those crown witnesses to-day. Every question told.”
“I always am sound; am I not?”
“I don’t gainsay it. What has roughened your temper? Put some
punch to it and smooth it again.”
With a deprecatory grunt, the jackal again complied.
“The old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School,” said Stryver,
nodding his head over him as he reviewed him in the present and the
past, “the old seesaw Sydney. Up one minute and down the next; now
in spirits and now in despondency!”
“Ah!” returned the other, sighing: “yes! The same Sydney, with the
same luck. Even then, I did exercises for other boys, and seldom did my
77
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
own.
“And why not?”
“God knows. It was my way, I suppose.”
He sat, with his hands in his pockets and his legs stretched out before
him, looking at the fire.
“Carton,” said his friend, squaring himself at him with a bullying air,
as if the fire-grate had been the furnace in which sustained endeavour
was forged, and the one delicate thing to be done for the old Sydney Carton of old Shrewsbury School was to shoulder him into it, “your way
is, and always was, a lame way. You summon no energy and purpose.
Look at me.”
“Oh, botheration!” returned Sydney, with a lighter and more goodhumoured laugh, “don’t you be moral!”
“How have I done what I have done?” said Stryver; “how do I do
what I do?”
“Partly through paying me to help you, I suppose. But it’s not worth
your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do,
you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.”
“I had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?”
“I was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,”
said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed.
“Before Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,”
pursued Carton, “you have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into
mine. Even when we were fellow-students in the Student-Quarter of
Paris, picking up French, and French law, and other French crumbs that
we didn’t get much good of, you were always somewhere, and I was
always nowhere.”
“And whose fault was that?”
“Upon my soul, I am not sure that it was not yours. You were always
driving and riving and shouldering and passing, to that restless degree
that I had no chance for my life but in rust and repose. It’s a gloomy
thing, however, to talk about one’s own past, with the day breaking.
Turn me in some other direction before I go.”
“Well then! Pledge me to the pretty witness,” said Stryver, holding
up his glass. “Are you turned in a pleasant direction?”
Apparently not, for he became gloomy again.
“Pretty witness,” he muttered, looking down into his glass. “I have
had enough of witnesses to-day and to-night; who’s your pretty witness?”
78
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“The picturesque doctor’s daughter, Miss Manette.”
“She pretty?”
“Is she not?”
“No.”
“Why, man alive, she was the admiration of the whole Court!”
“Rot the admiration of the whole Court! Who made the Old Bailey
a judge of beauty? She was a golden-haired doll!”
“Do you know, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, looking at him with sharp
eyes, and slowly drawing a hand across his florid face: “do you know, I
rather thought, at the time, that you sympathised with the golden-haired
doll, and were quick to see what happened to the golden-haired doll?”
“Quick to see what happened! If a girl, doll or no doll, swoons
within a yard or two of a man’s nose, he can see it without a perspectiveglass. I pledge you, but I deny the beauty. And now I’ll have no more
drink; I’ll get to bed.”
When his host followed him out on the staircase with a candle, to
light him down the stairs, the day was coldly looking in through its
grimy windows. When he got out of the house, the air was cold and
sad, the dull sky overcast, the river dark and dim, the whole scene like
a lifeless desert. And wreaths of dust were spinning round and round
before the morning blast, as if the desert-sand had risen far away, and
the first spray of it in its advance had begun to overwhelm the city.
Waste forces within him, and a desert all around, this man stood
still on his way across a silent terrace, and saw for a moment, lying in
the wilderness before him, a mirage of honourable ambition, self-denial,
and perseverance. In the fair city of this vision, there were airy galleries
from which the loves and graces looked upon him, gardens in which the
fruits of life hung ripening, waters of Hope that sparkled in his sight.
A moment, and it was gone. Climbing to a high chamber in a well of
houses, he threw himself down in his clothes on a neglected bed, and its
pillow was wet with wasted tears.
Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man
of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise,
incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight
on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.

Chapter 6
Hundreds of People
The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not
far from Soho-square. On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when
the waves of four months had roiled over the trial for treason, and
carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis
Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived,
on his way to dine with the Doctor. After several relapses into businessabsorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor’s friend, and the quiet
street-corner was the sunny part of his life.
On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early
in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine
Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie;
secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be
with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window,
and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to
have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of
the Doctor’s household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving
them.
A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not
to be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front
windows of the Doctor’s lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of
street that had a congenial air of retirement on it. There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and
wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished
fields. As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous
freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on
which the peaches ripened in their season.
The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part
of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow,
though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into
a glare of brightness. It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful
place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.
There ought to have been a tranquil bark in such an anchorage, and
there was. The Doctor occupied two floors of a large stiff house, where
several callings purported to be pursued by day, but whereof little was
80
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
audible any day, and which was shunned by all of them at night. In
a building at the back, attainable by a courtyard where a plane-tree
rustled its green leaves, church-organs claimed to be made, and silver
to be chased, and likewise gold to be beaten by some mysterious giant
who had a golden arm starting out of the wall of the front hall—as if
he had beaten himself precious, and menaced a similar conversion of
all visitors. Very little of these trades, or of a lonely lodger rumoured
to live up-stairs, or of a dim coach-trimming maker asserted to have
a counting-house below, was ever heard or seen. Occasionally, a stray
workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered
about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a
thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions
required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the
house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from
Sunday morning unto Saturday night.
Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation,
and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him. His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned
as much as he wanted.
These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry’s knowledge, thoughts,
and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the
corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.
“Doctor Manette at home?”
Expected home.
“Miss Lucie at home?”
Expected home.
“Miss Pross at home?”
Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact.
“As I am at home myself,” said Mr. Lorry, “I’ll go upstairs.”
Although the Doctor’s daughter had known nothing of the country
of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability
to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics. Simple as the furniture was, it was set off by so
many little adornments, of no value but for their taste and fancy, that its
effect was delightful. The disposition of everything in the rooms, from
the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant
variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear
81
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so
expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about
him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of
that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he
approved?
There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they
communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through
them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance
which he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first
was the best room, and in it were Lucie’s birds, and flowers, and books,
and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was
the Doctor’s consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third,
changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
Doctor’s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker’s
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris.
“I wonder,” said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, “that he
keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!”
“And why wonder at that?” was the abrupt inquiry that made him
start.
It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand,
whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at
Dover, and had since improved.
“I should have thought—” Mr. Lorry began.
“Pooh! You’d have thought!” said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left
off.
“How do you do?” inquired that lady then—sharply, and yet as if
to express that she bore him no malice.
“I am pretty well, I thank you,” answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness;
“how are you?”
“Nothing to boast of,” said Miss Pross.
“Indeed?”
“Ah! indeed!” said Miss Pross. “I am very much put out about my
Ladybird.”
“Indeed?”
“For gracious sake say something else besides ‘indeed,’ or you’ll fidget me to death,” said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from
stature) was shortness.
“Really, then?” said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment.
82
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Really, is bad enough,” returned Miss Pross, “but better. Yes, I am
very much put out.”
“May I ask the cause?”
“I don’t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,” said Miss Pross.
“Do dozens come for that purpose?”
“Hundreds,” said Miss Pross.
It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
she exaggerated it.
“Dear me!” said Mr. Lorry, as the safest remark he could think of.
“I have lived with the darling—or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may
take your affidavit, if I could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing—since she was ten years old. And it’s really very hard,” said
Miss Pross.
Not seeing with precision what was very hard, Mr. Lorry shook his
head; using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that
would fit anything.
“All sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the
pet, are always turning up,” said Miss Pross. “When you began it—”
“I began it, Miss Pross?”
“Didn’t you? Who brought her father to life?”
“Oh! If that was beginning it—” said Mr. Lorry.
“It wasn’t ending it, I suppose? I say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that I have any fault to find with Doctor Manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. But it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (I could have forgiven
him), to take Ladybird’s affections away from me.”
Mr. Lorry knew Miss Pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her
by this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures—found only among women—who will, for pure love
and admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have
lost it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives. He knew enough of the world to know that
there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so
83
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind—we all make such arrangements, more or less—he stationed Miss
Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson’s.
“There never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,”
said Miss Pross; “and that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn’t made
a mistake in life.”
Here again: Mr. Lorry’s inquiries into Miss Pross’s personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless
scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake
to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore,
with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross’s fidelity of belief in Solomon
(deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her.
“As we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people
of business,” he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room
and had sat down there in friendly relations, “let me ask you—does the
Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?”
“Never.”
“And yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?”
“Ah!” returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. “But I don’t say he
don’t refer to it within himself.”
“Do you believe that he thinks of it much?”
“I do,” said Miss Pross.
“Do you imagine—” Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took
him up short with:
“Never imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.”
“I stand corrected; do you suppose—you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?”
“Now and then,” said Miss Pross.
“Do you suppose,” Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in
his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, “that Doctor Manette has
any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?”
“I don’t suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.”
“And that is—?”
“That she thinks he has.”
84
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Now don’t be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am
a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.”
“Dull?” Miss Pross inquired, with placidity.
Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, “No,
no, no. Surely not. To return to business:—Is it not remarkable that
Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all
well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say
with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and
we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so
devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him? Believe
me, Miss Pross, I don’t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity,
but out of zealous interest.”
“Well! To the best of my understanding, and bad’s the best, you’ll
tell me,” said Miss Pross, softened by the tone of the apology, “he is
afraid of the whole subject.”
“Afraid?”
“It’s plain enough, I should think, why he may be. It’s a dreadful
remembrance. Besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. Not
knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may
never feel certain of not losing himself again. That alone wouldn’t make
the subject pleasant, I should think.”
It was a profounder remark than Mr. Lorry had looked for. “True,”
said he, “and fearful to reflect upon. Yet, a doubt lurks in my mind,
Miss Pross, whether it is good for Doctor Manette to have that suppression always shut up within him. Indeed, it is this doubt and the
uneasiness it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.”
“Can’t be helped,” said Miss Pross, shaking her head. “Touch that
string, and he instantly changes for the worse. Better leave it alone. In
short, must leave it alone, like or no like. Sometimes, he gets up in the
dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking up
and down, walking up and down, in his room. Ladybird has learnt to
know then that his mind is walking up and down, walking up and down,
in his old prison. She hurries to him, and they go on together, walking
up and down, walking up and down, until he is composed. But he never
says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds
it best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
brought him to himself.”
85
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Notwithstanding Miss Pross’s denial of her own imagination, there
was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one
sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which
testified to her possessing such a thing.
The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going.
“Here they are!” said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference;
“and now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!”
It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they
would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed
close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and
Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them.
Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling’s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as
much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had
been the vainest and handsomest of women. Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against
her taking so much trouble for her—which last she only dared to do
playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own
chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at
them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for
having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds
of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the
fulfilment of Miss Pross’s prediction.
Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements
of the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
86
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be better. Miss Pross’s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind, she
had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would impart
culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters of
Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress, or
Cinderella’s Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit, a
vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
pleased.
On Sundays, Miss Pross dined at the Doctor’s table, but on other
days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the
lower regions, or in her own room on the second floor—a blue chamber, to which no one but her Ladybird ever gained admittance. On this
occasion, Miss Pross, responding to Ladybird’s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very
pleasant, too.
It was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, Lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air. As everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of Mr. Lorry. She had installed herself, some time
before, as Mr. Lorry’s cup-bearer; and while they sat under the planetree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. Mysterious backs and ends
of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree whispered
to them in its own way above their heads.
Still, the Hundreds of people did not present themselves. Mr. Darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only One.
Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss
Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body,
and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, “a fit of the jerks.”
The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young.
The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times,
and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the
likeness.
He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual
87
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
vivacity. “Pray, Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under
the plane-tree—and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand,
which happened to be the old buildings of London—“have you seen
much of the Tower?”
“Lucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen
enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.”
“I have been there, as you remember,” said Darnay, with a smile,
though reddening a little angrily, “in another character, and not in a
character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a
curious thing when I was there.”
“What was that?” Lucie asked.
“In making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every
stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been
carved by prisoners—dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a
corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have
gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were
done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady
hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully
examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were
made what the name could have been. At length, it was suggested that
the letters were not initials, but the complete word, DiG. The floor was
examined very carefully under the inscription, and, in the earth beneath
a stone, or tile, or some fragment of paving, were found the ashes of a
paper, mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag. What the
unknown prisoner had written will never be read, but he had written
something, and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler.”
“My father,” exclaimed Lucie, “you are ill!”
He had suddenly started up, with his hand to his head. His manner
and his look quite terrified them all.
“No, my dear, not ill. There are large drops of rain falling, and they
made me start. We had better go in.”
He recovered himself almost instantly. Rain was really falling in
large drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it.
But, he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been
told of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of Mr. Lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned towards
Charles Darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it when it
88
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
turned towards him in the passages of the Court House.
He recovered himself so quickly, however, that Mr. Lorry had doubts
of his business eye. The arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that
he was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him.
Tea-time, and Miss Pross making tea, with another fit of the jerks
upon her, and yet no Hundreds of people. Mr. Carton had lounged in,
but he made only Two.
The night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat. When the tea-table
was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out
into the heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her;
Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and
some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up
to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings.
“The rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,” said Doctor
Manette. “It comes slowly.”
“It comes surely,” said Carton.
They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do.
There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to
get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there.
“A multitude of people, and yet a solitude!” said Darnay, when they
had listened for a while.
“Is it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?” asked Lucie. “Sometimes, I
have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied—but even the shade
of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and
solemn—”
“Let us shudder too. We may know what it is.”
“It will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as
we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated. I have
sometimes sat alone here of an evening, listening, until I have made the
echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-andbye into our lives.”
“There is a great crowd coming one day into our lives, if that be so,”
Sydney Carton struck in, in his moody way.
89
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The footsteps were incessant, and the hurry of them became more
and more rapid. The corner echoed and re-echoed with the tread of feet;
some, as it seemed, under the windows; some, as it seemed, in the room;
some coming, some going, some breaking off, some stopping altogether;
all in the distant streets, and not one within sight.
“Are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us, Miss Manette,
or are we to divide them among us?”
“I don’t know, Mr. Darnay; I told you it was a foolish fancy, but you
asked for it. When I have yielded myself to it, I have been alone, and
then I have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come
into my life, and my father’s.”
“I take them into mine!” said Carton. “I ask no questions and make
no stipulations. There is a great crowd bearing down upon us, Miss
Manette, and I see them—by the Lightning.” He added the last words,
after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the
window.
“And I hear them!” he added again, after a peal of thunder. “Here
they come, fast, fierce, and furious!”
It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified, and it stopped him,
for no voice could be heard in it. A memorable storm of thunder and
lightning broke with that sweep of water, and there was not a moment’s
interval in crash, and fire, and rain, until after the moon rose at midnight.
The great bell of Saint Paul’s was striking one in the cleared air, when
Mr. Lorry, escorted by Jerry, high-booted and bearing a lantern, set forth
on his return-passage to Clerkenwell. There were solitary patches of
road on the way between Soho and Clerkenwell, and Mr. Lorry, mindful
of foot-pads, always retained Jerry for this service: though it was usually
performed a good two hours earlier.
“What a night it has been! Almost a night, Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry,
“to bring the dead out of their graves.”
“I never see the night myself, master—nor yet I don’t expect to—
what would do that,” answered Jerry.
“Good night, Mr. Carton,” said the man of business. “Good night,
Mr. Darnay. Shall we ever see such a night again, together!”
Perhaps. Perhaps, see the great crowd of people with its rush and
roar, bearing down upon them, too.

Chapter 7
Monseigneur in Town
Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his
fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in
his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to
the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur
was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great
many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to
be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning’s chocolate could
not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of
four strong men besides the Cook.
Yes. It took four men, all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration, and
the Chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches
in his pocket, emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by Monseigneur, to conduct the happy chocolate to Monseigneur’s lips. One
lacquey carried the chocolate-pot into the sacred presence; a second,
milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for
that function; a third, presented the favoured napkin; a fourth (he of
the two gold watches), poured the chocolate out. It was impossible for
Monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate
and hold his high place under the admiring Heavens. Deep would have
been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly
waited on by only three men; he must have died of two.
Monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night, where the
Comedy and the Grand Opera were charmingly represented. Monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights, with fascinating company. So polite and so impressible was Monseigneur, that the Comedy
and the Grand Opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome
articles of state affairs and state secrets, than the needs of all France. A
happy circumstance for France, as the like always is for all countries
similarly favoured!—always was for England (by way of example), in
the regretted days of the merry Stuart who sold it.
Monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business,
which was, to let everything go on in its own way; of particular public
business, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all
go his way—tend to his own power and pocket. Of his pleasures, general and particular, Monseigneur had the other truly noble idea, that
91
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the world was made for them. The text of his order (altered from the
original by only a pronoun, which is not much) ran: “The earth and the
fulness thereof are mine, saith Monseigneur.”
Yet, Monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments
crept into his affairs, both private and public; and he had, as to both
classes of affairs, allied himself perforce with a Farmer-General. As to
finances public, because Monseigneur could not make anything at all of
them, and must consequently let them out to somebody who could; as to
finances private, because Farmer-Generals were rich, and Monseigneur,
after generations of great luxury and expense, was growing poor. Hence
Monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent, while there was yet
time to ward off the impending veil, the cheapest garment she could
wear, and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich Farmer-General,
poor in family. Which Farmer-General, carrying an appropriate cane
with a golden apple on the top of it, was now among the company in
the outer rooms, much prostrated before by mankind—always excepting superior mankind of the blood of Monseigneur, who, his own wife
included, looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt.
A sumptuous man was the Farmer-General. Thirty horses stood in
his stables, twenty-four male domestics sat in his halls, six body-women
waited on his wife. As one who pretended to do nothing but plunder
and forage where he could, the Farmer-General—howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality—was at least the greatest
reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of Monseigneur
that day.
For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned
with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could
achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not
so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost
equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would
have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business—if that could have
been anybody’s business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a
ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of
the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser
lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of
Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from
92
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score
and the score. People not immediately connected with Monseigneur
or the State, yet equally unconnected with anything that was real, or
with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly
end, were no less abundant. Doctors who made great fortunes out of
dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed, smiled upon
their courtly patients in the ante-chambers of Monseigneur. Projectors
who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which
the State was touched, except the remedy of setting to work in earnest
to root out a single sin, poured their distracting babble into any ears
they could lay hold of, at the reception of Monseigneur. Unbelieving
Philosophers who were remodelling the world with words, and making
card-towers of Babel to scale the skies with, talked with Unbelieving
Chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals, at this wonderful gathering accumulated by Monseigneur. Exquisite gentlemen of
the finest breeding, which was at that remarkable time—and has been
since—to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject
of human interest, were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion, at
the hotel of Monseigneur. Such homes had these various notabilities
left behind them in the fine world of Paris, that the spies among the
assembled devotees of Monseigneur—forming a goodly half of the polite company—would have found it hard to discover among the angels
of that sphere one solitary wife, who, in her manners and appearance,
owned to being a Mother. Indeed, except for the mere act of bringing
a troublesome creature into this world—which does not go far towards
the realisation of the name of mother—there was no such thing known
to the fashion. Peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close, and
brought them up, and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and
supped as at twenty.
The leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon Monseigneur. In the outermost room were half a dozen
exceptional people who had had, for a few years, some vague misgiving
in them that things in general were going rather wrong. As a promising
way of setting them right, half of the half-dozen had become members of
a fantastic sect of Convulsionists, and were even then considering within
themselves whether they should foam, rage, roar, and turn cataleptic on
the spot—thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger-post to the Future, for Monseigneur’s guidance. Besides these Dervishes, were other
three who had rushed into another sect, which mended matters with a
93
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
jargon about “the Centre of Truth:” holding that Man had got out of
the Centre of Truth—which did not need much demonstration—but had
not got out of the Circumference, and that he was to be kept from flying
out of the Circumference, and was even to be shoved back into the Centre, by fasting and seeing of spirits. Among these, accordingly, much
discoursing with spirits went on—and it did a world of good which
never became manifest.
But, the comfort was, that all the company at the grand hotel of
Monseigneur were perfectly dressed. If the Day of Judgment had only
been ascertained to be a dress day, everybody there would have been
eternally correct. Such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair,
such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended, such gallant swords to look at, and such delicate honour to the sense of smell,
would surely keep anything going, for ever and ever. The exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as
they languidly moved; these golden fetters rang like precious little bells;
and what with that ringing, and with the rustle of silk and brocade and
fine linen, there was a flutter in the air that fanned Saint Antoine and
his devouring hunger far away.
Dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping
all things in their places. Everybody was dressed for a Fancy Ball that
was never to leave off. From the Palace of the Tuileries, through Monseigneur and the whole Court, through the Chambers, the Tribunals of
Justice, and all society (except the scarecrows), the Fancy Ball descended
to the Common Executioner: who, in pursuance of the charm, was required to officiate “frizzled, powdered, in a gold-laced coat, pumps, and
white silk stockings.” At the gallows and the wheel—the axe was a
rarity—Monsieur Paris, as it was the episcopal mode among his brother
Professors of the provinces, Monsieur Orleans, and the rest, to call him,
presided in this dainty dress. And who among the company at Monseigneur’s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our
Lord, could possibly doubt, that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman,
powdered, gold-laced, pumped, and white-silk stockinged, would see
the very stars out!
Monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken
his chocolate, caused the doors of the Holiest of Holiests to be thrown
open, and issued forth. Then, what submission, what cringing and fawning, what servility, what abject humiliation! As to bowing down in body
and spirit, nothing in that way was left for Heaven—which may have
94
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
been one among other reasons why the worshippers of Monseigneur
never troubled it.
Bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there, a whisper on
one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another, Monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the Circumference
of Truth. There, Monseigneur turned, and came back again, and so in
due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate
sprites, and was seen no more.
The show being over, the flutter in the air became quite a little storm,
and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs. There was soon
but one person left of all the crowd, and he, with his hat under his arm
and his snuff-box in his hand, slowly passed among the mirrors on his
way out.
“I devote you,” said this person, stopping at the last door on his way,
and turning in the direction of the sanctuary, “to the Devil!”
With that, he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken
the dust from his feet, and quietly walked downstairs.
He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness;
every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose,
beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of
each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change
that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour
sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by
something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery,
and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth,
and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and
thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a
remarkable one.
Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage,
and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception;
he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been
warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather
agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses,
and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if
he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man
brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and
95
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar
in a barbarous manner. But, few cared enough for that to think of it a
second time, and, in this matter, as in all others, the common wretches
were left to get out of their difficulties as they could.
With a wild rattle and clatter, and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days, the carriage dashed
through streets and swept round corners, with women screaming before
it, and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way.
At last, swooping at a street corner by a fountain, one of its wheels
came to a sickening little jolt, and there was a loud cry from a number
of voices, and the horses reared and plunged.
But for the latter inconvenience, the carriage probably would not
have stopped; carriages were often known to drive on, and leave their
wounded behind, and why not? But the frightened valet had got down
in a hurry, and there were twenty hands at the horses’ bridles.
“What has gone wrong?” said Monsieur, calmly looking out.
A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the
feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and
was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal.
“Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!” said a ragged and submissive
man, “it is a child.”
“Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?”
“Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis—it is a pity—yes.”
The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it
was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man
suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage,
Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his swordhilt.
“Killed!” shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both
arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. “Dead!”
The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis.
There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but
watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger.
Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been
silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had
spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out
of their holes.
96
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He took out his purse.
“It is extraordinary to me,” said he, “that you people cannot take
care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever
in the, way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See!
Give him that.”
He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads
craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall
man called out again with a most unearthly cry, “Dead!”
He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the
rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his
shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some
women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently
about it. They were as silent, however, as the men.
“I know all, I know all,” said the last comer. “Be a brave man, my
Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live.
It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as
happily?”
“You are a philosopher, you there,” said the, Marquis, smiling.
“How do they call you?”
“They call me Defarge.”
“Of what trade?”
“Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.”
“Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,” said the Marquis,
throwing him another gold coin, “and spend it as you will. The horses
there; are they right?”
Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur
the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away
with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common
thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease
was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on
its floor.
“Hold!” said Monsieur the Marquis. “Hold the horses! Who threw
that?”
He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood,
a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on
the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the
figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.
“You dogs!” said the Marquis, but smoothly, and with an unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: “I would ride over
97
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew
which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently
near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.”
So cowed was their condition, and so long and hard their experience
of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it,
that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye was raised. Among the men,
not one. But the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and
looked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it;
his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and
he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word “Go on!”
He was driven on, and other carriages came whirling by in quick
succession; the Minister, the State-Projector, the Farmer-General, the
Doctor, the Lawyer, the Ecclesiastic, the Grand Opera, the Comedy, the
whole Fancy Ball in a bright continuous flow, came whirling by. The rats
had crept out of their holes to look on, and they remained looking on for
hours; soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle,
and making a barrier behind which they slunk, and through which they
peeped. The father had long ago taken up his bundle and bidden himself
away with it, when the women who had tended the bundle while it
lay on the base of the fountain, sat there watching the running of the
water and the rolling of the Fancy Ball—when the one woman who had
stood conspicuous, knitting, still knitted on with the steadfastness of
Fate. The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into
evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time
and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their
dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran
their course.
Chapter 8
Monseigneur in the Country
A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.
Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas
and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On
inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly—a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away.
98
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have
been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged
up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis
was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was
occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control—the setting
sun.
The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it
gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. “It will
die out,” said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, “directly.”
In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the
heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down
hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed
quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no
glow left when the drag was taken off.
But, there remained a broken country, bold and open, a little village
at the bottom of the hill, a broad sweep and rise beyond it, a churchtower, a windmill, a forest for the chase, and a crag with a fortress on
it used as a prison. Round upon all these darkening objects as the night
drew on, the Marquis looked, with the air of one who was coming near
home.
The village had its one poor street, with its poor brewery, poor tannery, poor tavern, poor stable-yard for relays of post-horses, poor fountain, all usual poor appointments. It had its poor people too. All its people were poor, and many of them were sitting at their doors, shredding
spare onions and the like for supper, while many were at the fountain,
washing leaves, and grasses, and any such small yieldings of the earth
that could be eaten. Expressive sips of what made them poor, were not
wanting; the tax for the state, the tax for the church, the tax for the lord,
tax local and tax general, were to be paid here and to be paid there, according to solemn inscription in the little village, until the wonder was,
that there was any village left unswallowed.
Few children were to be seen, and no dogs. As to the men and
women, their choice on earth was stated in the prospect—Life on the
lowest terms that could sustain it, down in the little village under the
mill; or captivity and Death in the dominant prison on the crag.
Heralded by a courier in advance, and by the cracking of his postilions’ whips, which twined snake-like about their heads in the evening
air, as if he came attended by the Furies, Monsieur the Marquis drew up
in his travelling carriage at the posting-house gate. It was hard by the
99
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fountain, and the peasants suspended their operations to look at him.
He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure
filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the
truth through the best part of a hundred years.
Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that
drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court—only the difference was, that these faces drooped
merely to suffer and not to propitiate—when a grizzled mender of the
roads joined the group.
“Bring me hither that fellow!” said the Marquis to the courier.
The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed
round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain.
“I passed you on the road?”
“Monseigneur, it is true. I had the honour of being passed on the
road.”
“Coming up the hill, and at the top of the hill, both?”
“Monseigneur, it is true.”
“What did you look at, so fixedly?”
“Monseigneur, I looked at the man.”
He stooped a little, and with his tattered blue cap pointed under the
carriage. All his fellows stooped to look under the carriage.
“What man, pig? And why look there?”
“Pardon, Monseigneur; he swung by the chain of the shoe—the
drag.”
“Who?” demanded the traveller.
“Monseigneur, the man.”
“May the Devil carry away these idiots! How do you call the man?
You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?”
“Your clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.”
“Swinging by the chain? To be suffocated?”
“With your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over—like this!”
He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with
his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow.
“What was he like?”
100
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Monseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust,
white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!”
The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but
all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur
the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his
conscience.
“Truly, you did well,” said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that
such vermin were not to ruffle him, “to see a thief accompanying my
carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside,
Monsieur Gabelle!”
Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at
this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm
in an official manner.
“Bah! Go aside!” said Monsieur Gabelle.
“Lay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village tonight, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.”
“Monseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.”
“Did he run away, fellow?—where is that Accursed?”
The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen
particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap. Some halfdozen other particular friends promptly hauled him out, and presented
him breathless to Monsieur the Marquis.
“Did the man run away, Dolt, when we stopped for the drag?”
“Monseigneur, he precipitated himself over the hill-side, head first,
as a person plunges into the river.”
“See to it, Gabelle. Go on!”
The half-dozen who were peering at the chain were still among the
wheels, like sheep; the wheels turned so suddenly that they were lucky
to save their skins and bones; they had very little else to save, or they
might not have been so fortunate.
The burst with which the carriage started out of the village and up
the rise beyond, was soon checked by the steepness of the hill. Gradually,
it subsided to a foot pace, swinging and lumbering upward among the
many sweet scents of a summer night. The postilions, with a thousand
gossamer gnats circling about them in lieu of the Furies, quietly mended
the points to the lashes of their whips; the valet walked by the horses;
the courier was audible, trotting on ahead into the dun distance.
At the steepest point of the hill there was a little burial-ground, with
101
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
a Cross and a new large figure of Our Saviour on it; it was a poor figure
in wood, done by some inexperienced rustic carver, but he had studied
the figure from the life—his own life, maybe—for it was dreadfully spare
and thin.
To this distressful emblem of a great distress that had long been
growing worse, and was not at its worst, a woman was kneeling. She
turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door.
“It is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.”
With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face,
Monseigneur looked out.
“How, then! What is it? Always petitions!”
“Monseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the
forester.”
“What of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you
people. He cannot pay something?”
“He has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.”
“Well! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?”
“Alas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of
poor grass.”
“Well?”
“Monseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?”
“Again, well?”
She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one
of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands
together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door—
tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be
expected to feel the appealing touch.
“Monseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of
want.”
“Again, well? Can I feed them?”
“Monseigneur, the good God knows; but I don’t ask it. My petition
is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband’s name, may be
placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be
quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same
malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass. Monseigneur, they are so many, they increase so fast, there is so much want.
Monseigneur! Monseigneur!”
102
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The valet had put her away from the door, the carriage had broken
into a brisk trot, the postilions had quickened the pace, she was left
far behind, and Monseigneur, again escorted by the Furies, was rapidly
diminishing the league or two of distance that remained between him
and his chateau.
The sweet scents of the summer night rose all around him, and rose,
as the rain falls, impartially, on the dusty, ragged, and toil-worn group
at the fountain not far away; to whom the mender of roads, with the
aid of the blue cap without which he was nothing, still enlarged upon
his man like a spectre, as long as they could bear it. By degrees, as they
could bear no more, they dropped off one by one, and lights twinkled
in little casements; which lights, as the casements darkened, and more
stars came out, seemed to have shot up into the sky instead of having
been extinguished.
The shadow of a large high-roofed house, and of many over-hanging
trees, was upon Monsieur the Marquis by that time; and the shadow
was exchanged for the light of a flambeau, as his carriage stopped, and
the great door of his chateau was opened to him.
“Monsieur Charles, whom I expect; is he arrived from England?”
“Monseigneur, not yet.”
Chapter 9
The Gorgon’s Head
It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis,
with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase
meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business
altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions.
As if the Gorgon’s head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.
Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile
of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the
flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great
door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in
103
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the open night-air. Other sound than the owl’s voice there was none,
save the failing of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those
dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave
a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.
The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis
crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives
of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips,
of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the
weight when his lord was angry.
Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the
night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before,
went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber
and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great
dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all
luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to
break—the fourteenth Louis—was conspicuous in their rich furniture;
but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old
pages in the history of France.
A supper-table was laid for two, in the third of the rooms; a round
room, in one of the chateau’s four extinguisher-topped towers. A small
lofty room, with its window wide open, and the wooden jalousie-blinds
closed, so that the dark night only showed in slight horizontal lines of
black, alternating with their broad lines of stone colour.
“My nephew,” said the Marquis, glancing at the supper preparation;
“they said he was not arrived.”
Nor was he; but, he had been expected with Monseigneur.
“Ah! It is not probable he will arrive to-night; nevertheless, leave
the table as it is. I shall be ready in a quarter of an hour.”
In a quarter of an hour Monseigneur was ready, and sat down alone
to his sumptuous and choice supper. His chair was opposite to the window, and he had taken his soup, and was raising his glass of Bordeaux
to his lips, when he put it down.
“What is that?” he calmly asked, looking with attention at the horizontal lines of black and stone colour.
“Monseigneur? That?”
“Outside the blinds. Open the blinds.”
It was done.
104
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Well?”
“Monseigneur, it is nothing. The trees and the night are all that are
here.”
The servant who spoke, had thrown the blinds wide, had looked out
into the vacant darkness, and stood with that blank behind him, looking
round for instructions.
“Good,” said the imperturbable master. “Close them again.”
That was done too, and the Marquis went on with his supper. He
was half way through it, when he again stopped with his glass in his
hand, hearing the sound of wheels. It came on briskly, and came up to
the front of the chateau.
“Ask who is arrived.”
It was the nephew of Monseigneur. He had been some few leagues
behind Monseigneur, early in the afternoon. He had diminished the
distance rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with Monseigneur on
the road. He had heard of Monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being
before him.
He was to be told (said Monseigneur) that supper awaited him then
and there, and that he was prayed to come to it. In a little while he
came. He had been known in England as Charles Darnay.
Monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not
shake hands.
“You left Paris yesterday, sir?” he said to Monseigneur, as he took
his seat at table.
“Yesterday. And you?”
“I come direct.”
“From London?”
“Yes.”
“You have been a long time coming,” said the Marquis, with a smile.
“On the contrary; I come direct.”
“Pardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time
intending the journey.”
“I have been detained by”—the nephew stopped a moment in his
answer—“various business.”
“Without doubt,” said the polished uncle.
So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between
them. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the
nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was
like a fine mask, opened a conversation.
105
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that
took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is
a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have
sustained me.”
“Not to death,” said the uncle; “it is not necessary to say, to death.”
“I doubt, sir,” returned the nephew, “whether, if it had carried me
to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.”
The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine
straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle
made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of
good breeding that it was not reassuring.
“Indeed, sir,” pursued the nephew, “for anything I know, you may
have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.”
“No, no, no,” said the uncle, pleasantly.
“But, however that may be,” resumed the nephew, glancing at him
with deep distrust, “I know that your diplomacy would stop me by any
means, and would know no scruple as to means.”
“My friend, I told you so,” said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in
the two marks. “Do me the favour to recall that I told you so, long
ago.”
“I recall it.”
“Thank you,” said the Marquise—very sweetly indeed.
His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument.
“In effect, sir,” pursued the nephew, “I believe it to be at once your
bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in
France here.”
“I do not quite understand,” returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.
“Dare I ask you to explain?”
“I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had
not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet
would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.”
“It is possible,” said the uncle, with great calmness. “For the honour
of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent.
Pray excuse me!”
“I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before
yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,” observed the nephew.
“I would not say happily, my friend,” returned the uncle, with re106
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fined politeness; “I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity
for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for
yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a
disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to
the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity.
They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so
few! It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the
worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over
the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been
taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to
our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent
delicacy respecting his daughter—his daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our
station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but
might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!”
The Marquis took a gentle little pinch of snuff, and shook his head;
as elegantly despondent as he could becomingly be of a country still
containing himself, that great means of regeneration.
“We have so asserted our station, both in the old time and in the
modern time also,” said the nephew, gloomily, “that I believe our name
to be more detested than any name in France.”
“Let us hope so,” said the uncle. “Detestation of the high is the
involuntary homage of the low.”
“There is not,” pursued the nephew, in his former tone, “a face I can
look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any
deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.”
“A compliment,” said the Marquis, “to the grandeur of the family,
merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur.
Hah!” And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly
crossed his legs.
But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his
eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at
him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and
dislike, than was comportable with its wearer’s assumption of indifference.
“Repression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of
fear and slavery, my friend,” observed the Marquis, “will keep the dogs
107
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,” looking up to it, “shuts out
the sky.”
That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of
the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as
they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to
him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the
ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof he vaunted,
he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way—to wit, for
ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the
barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.
“Meanwhile,” said the Marquis, “I will preserve the honour and
repose of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we
terminate our conference for the night?”
“A moment more.”
“An hour, if you please.”
“Sir,” said the nephew, “we have done wrong, and are reaping the
fruits of wrong.”
“We have done wrong?” repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring
smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself.
“Our family; our honourable family, whose honour is of so much
account to both of us, in such different ways. Even in my father’s time,
we did a world of wrong, injuring every human creature who came
between us and our pleasure, whatever it was. Why need I speak of
my father’s time, when it is equally yours? Can I separate my father’s
twin-brother, joint inheritor, and next successor, from himself?”
“Death has done that!” said the Marquis.
“And has left me,” answered the nephew, “bound to a system that is
frightful to me, responsible for it, but powerless in it; seeking to execute
the last request of my dear mother’s lips, and obey the last look of my
dear mother’s eyes, which implored me to have mercy and to redress;
and tortured by seeking assistance and power in vain.”
“Seeking them from me, my nephew,” said the Marquis, touching
him on the breast with his forefinger—they were now standing by the
hearth—“you will for ever seek them in vain, be assured.”
Every fine straight line in the clear whiteness of his face, was cruelly,
craftily, and closely compressed, while he stood looking quietly at his
nephew, with his snuff-box in his hand. Once again he touched him
on the breast, as though his finger were the fine point of a small sword,
with which, in delicate finesse, he ran him through the body, and said,
108
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“My friend, I will die, perpetuating the system under which I have
lived.”
When he had said it, he took a culminating pinch of snuff, and put
his box in his pocket.
“Better to be a rational creature,” he added then, after ringing a
small bell on the table, “and accept your natural destiny. But you are
lost, Monsieur Charles, I see.”
“This property and France are lost to me,” said the nephew, sadly;
“I renounce them.”
“Are they both yours to renounce? France may be, but is the property? It is scarcely worth mentioning; but, is it yet?”
“I had no intention, in the words I used, to claim it yet. If it passed
to me from you, to-morrow—”
“Which I have the vanity to hope is not probable.”
“—or twenty years hence—”
“You do me too much honour,” said the Marquis; “still, I prefer that
supposition.”
“—I would abandon it, and live otherwise and elsewhere. It is little
to relinquish. What is it but a wilderness of misery and ruin!”
“Hah!” said the Marquis, glancing round the luxurious room.
“To the eye it is fair enough, here; but seen in its integrity, under the
sky, and by the daylight, it is a crumbling tower of waste, mismanagement, extortion, debt, mortgage, oppression, hunger, nakedness, and
suffering.”
“Hah!” said the Marquis again, in a well-satisfied manner.
“If it ever becomes mine, it shall be put into some hands better qualified to free it slowly (if such a thing is possible) from the weight that
drags it down, so that the miserable people who cannot leave it and who
have been long wrung to the last point of endurance, may, in another
generation, suffer less; but it is not for me. There is a curse on it, and
on all this land.”
“And you?” said the uncle. “Forgive my curiosity; do you, under
your new philosophy, graciously intend to live?”
“I must do, to live, what others of my countrymen, even with nobility at their backs, may have to do some day-work.”
“In England, for example?”
“Yes. The family honour, sir, is safe from me in this country. The
family name can suffer from me in no other, for I bear it in no other.”
The ringing of the bell had caused the adjoining bed-chamber to
109
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
be lighted. It now shone brightly, through the door of communication.
The Marquis looked that way, and listened for the retreating step of his
valet.
“England is very attractive to you, seeing how indifferently you have
prospered there,” he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew
with a smile.
“I have already said, that for my prospering there, I am sensible I
may be indebted to you, sir. For the rest, it is my Refuge.”
“They say, those boastful English, that it is the Refuge of many. You
know a compatriot who has found a Refuge there? A Doctor?”
“Yes.”
“With a daughter?”
“Yes.”
“Yes,” said the Marquis. “You are fatigued. Good night!”
As he bent his head in his most courtly manner, there was a secrecy
in his smiling face, and he conveyed an air of mystery to those words,
which struck the eyes and ears of his nephew forcibly. At the same time,
the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight
lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked
handsomely diabolic.
“Yes,” repeated the Marquis. “A Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So
commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!”
It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked
at him, in vain, in passing on to the door.
“Good night!” said the uncle. “I look to the pleasure of seeing you
again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his
chamber there!—And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,”
he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned
his valet to his own bedroom.
The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro
in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot
still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making
no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:—looked like some
enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming
on.
He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking
again at the scraps of the day’s journey that came unbidden into his
110
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the
mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants
at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out
the chain under the carriage. That fountain suggested the Paris fountain,
the little bundle lying on the step, the women bending over it, and the
tall man with his arms up, crying, “Dead!”
“I am cool now,” said Monsieur the Marquis, “and may go to bed.”
So, leaving only one light burning on the large hearth, he let his thin
gauze curtains fall around him, and heard the night break its silence
with a long sigh as he composed himself to sleep.
The stone faces on the outer walls stared blindly at the black night
for three heavy hours; for three heavy hours, the horses in the stables
rattled at their racks, the dogs barked, and the owl made a noise with
very little resemblance in it to the noise conventionally assigned to the
owl by men-poets. But it is the obstinate custom of such creatures hardly
ever to say what is set down for them.
For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape,
dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads.
The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass
were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might
have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village,
taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as
the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the
yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.
The fountain in the village flowed unseen and unheard, and the fountain at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard—both melting away,
like the minutes that were falling from the spring of Time—through
three dark hours. Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in
the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.
Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still
trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water of
the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weatherbeaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the
Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this,
the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth
and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.
Now, the sun was full up, and movement began in the village. Case111
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ment windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came
forth shivering—chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the
rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to
the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve;
men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony
cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the
church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its
foot.
The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually
and surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had
been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning
sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their
stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows,
dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.
All these trivial incidents belonged to the routine of life, and the
return of morning. Surely, not so the ringing of the great bell of the
chateau, nor the running up and down the stairs; nor the hurried figures on the terrace; nor the booting and tramping here and there and
everywhere, nor the quick saddling of horses and riding away?
What winds conveyed this hurry to the grizzled mender of roads,
already at work on the hill-top beyond the village, with his day’s dinner
(not much to carry) lying in a bundle that it was worth no crow’s while
to peck at, on a heap of stones? Had the birds, carrying some grains
of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds?
Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for
his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got
to the fountain.
All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in
their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in
and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly
on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their
trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of
the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and
all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded
on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly
fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into
112
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself
in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on
horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden
though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German
ballad of Leonora?
It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the
chateau.
The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had
added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited
through about two hundred years.
It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine
mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into
the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt
was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled:
“Drive him fast to his tomb. This, from Jacques.”
Chapter 10
Two Promises
More months, to the number of twelve, had come and gone, and Mr.
Charles Darnay was established in England as a higher teacher of the
French language who was conversant with French literature. In this age,
he would have been a Professor; in that age, he was a Tutor. He read
with young men who could find any leisure and interest for the study
of a living tongue spoken all over the world, and he cultivated a taste
for its stores of knowledge and fancy. He could write of them, besides,
in sound English, and render them into sound English. Such masters
were not at that time easily found; Princes that had been, and Kings that
were to be, were not yet of the Teacher class, and no ruined nobility had
dropped out of Tellson’s ledgers, to turn cooks and carpenters. As a tutor, whose attainments made the student’s way unusually pleasant and
profitable, and as an elegant translator who brought something to his
work besides mere dictionary knowledge, young Mr. Darnay soon became known and encouraged. He was well acquainted, more-over, with
the circumstances of his country, and those were of ever-growing interest. So, with great perseverance and untiring industry, he prospered.
113
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
In London, he had expected neither to walk on pavements of gold,
nor to lie on beds of roses; if he had had any such exalted expectation,
he would not have prospered. He had expected labour, and he found it,
and did it and made the best of it. In this, his prosperity consisted.
A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek
and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in
London.
Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these
days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way—Charles Darnay’s way—the way of the love
of a woman.
He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had
never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when
it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been
dug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and
the long, tong, dusty roads—the solid stone chateau which had itself
become the mere mist of a dream—had been done a year, and he had
never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state
of his heart.
That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer
day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross.
He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The
energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and
aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He
was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose,
strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy
he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in
the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.
He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay,
at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.
114
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Charles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on
your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than
due.”
“I am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,” he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. “Miss
Manette—”
“Is well,” said the Doctor, as he stopped short, “and your return
will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but
will soon be home.”
“Doctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.”
There was a blank silence.
“Yes?” said the Doctor, with evident constraint. “Bring your chair
here, and speak on.”
He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on
less easy.
“I have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate
here,” so he at length began, “for some year and a half, that I hope the
topic on which I am about to touch may not—”
He was stayed by the Doctor’s putting out his hand to stop him.
When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:
“Is Lucie the topic?”
“She is.”
“It is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.”
“It is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!” he said deferentially.
There was another blank silence before her father rejoined:
“I believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.”
His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that
it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles
Darnay hesitated.
“Shall I go on, sir?”
Another blank.
“Yes, go on.”
“You anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how
earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret
heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long
115
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly,
disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.
You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!”
The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the
ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly,
and cried:
“Not that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!”
His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay’s ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had
extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter
so received it, and remained silent.
“I ask your pardon,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some
moments. “I do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of
it.”
He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or
raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair
overshadowed his face:
“Have you spoken to Lucie?”
“No.”
“Nor written?”
“Never.”
“It would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial
is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks
you.
He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it.
“I know,” said Darnay, respectfully, “how can I fail to know, Doctor
Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between
you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching,
so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that
it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and
child. I know, Doctor Manette—how can I fail to know—that, mingled
with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman,
there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy
itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is
now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present
years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the
early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if
you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could
hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that
116
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to
you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your
neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her
own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted,
loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I
have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.”
Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a
little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation.
“Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and
you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne,
as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even
now feel, that to bring my love—even mine—between you, is to touch
your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her.
Heaven is my witness that I love her!”
“I believe it,” answered her father, mournfully. “I have thought so
before now. I believe it.”
“But, do not believe,” said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful
voice struck with a reproachful sound, “that if my fortune were so cast
as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any
time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe
a word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless,
I should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at a
remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my
heart—if it ever had been there—if it ever could be there—I could not
now touch this honoured hand.”
He laid his own upon it as he spoke.
“No, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France;
like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries;
like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting
in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your
life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide with
Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in
aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.”
His touch still lingered on her father’s hand. Answering the touch
for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms
of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.
“You speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I
117
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart—or nearly
so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?”
“None. As yet, none.”
“Is it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?”
“Not even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.”
“Do you seek any guidance from me?”
“I ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have
it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.”
“Do you seek any promise from me?”
“I do seek that.”
“What is it?”
“I well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well
understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her
innocent heart-do not think I have the presumption to assume so much—
I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.”
“If that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?”
“I understand equally well, that a word from her father in any
suitor’s favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which
reason, Doctor Manette,” said Darnay, modestly but firmly, “I would
not ask that word, to save my life.”
“I am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love,
as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her
heart.”
“May I ask, sir, if you think she is—” As he hesitated, her father
supplied the rest.
“Is sought by any other suitor?”
“It is what I meant to say.”
Her father considered a little before he answered:
“You have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too,
occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.”
“Or both,” said Darnay.
“I had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You
want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.”
“It is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her
own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you
118
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope
you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against
me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The
condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, I will observe immediately.”
“I give the promise,” said the Doctor, “without any condition. I
believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it.
I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. If she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If
there were—Charles Darnay, if there were—”
The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were
joined as the Doctor spoke:
“—any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved—the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head—they should all be obliterated for
her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to
me than wrong, more to me—Well! This is idle talk.”
So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange
his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own
hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it.
“You said something to me,” said Doctor Manette, breaking into a
smile. “What was it you said to me?”
He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken
of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered:
“Your confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence
on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my
mother’s, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what
that is, and why I am in England.”
“Stop!” said the Doctor of Beauvais.
“I wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have
no secret from you.”
“Stop!”
For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay’s lips.
“Tell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if
Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do
you promise?”
“Willingly.
119
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Give me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!”
It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later
and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone—
for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs—and was surprised to find
his reading-chair empty.
“My father!” she called to him. “Father dear!”
Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound
in his bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked
in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with
her blood all chilled, “What shall I do! What shall I do!”
Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped
at his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of
her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and
down together for a long time.
She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night.
He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual.
Chapter 11
A Companion Picture
“Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his
jackal; “mix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.”
Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession,
making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver’s papers before the setting
in of the long vacation. The clearance was effected at last; the Stryver
arrears were handsomely fetched up; everything was got rid of until
November should come with its fogs atmospheric, and fogs legal, and
bring grist to the mill again.
Sydney was none the livelier and none the soberer for so much application. It had taken a deal of extra wet-towelling to pull him through
the night; a correspondingly extra quantity of wine had preceded the
towelling; and he was in a very damaged condition, as he now pulled
his turban off and threw it into the basin in which he had steeped it at
intervals for the last six hours.

A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Are you mixing that other bowl of punch?” said Stryver the portly,
with his hands in his waistband, glancing round from the sofa where he
lay on his back.
“I am.”
“Now, look here! I am going to tell you something that will rather
surprise you, and that perhaps will make you think me not quite as
shrewd as you usually do think me. I intend to marry.”
“Do you?”
“Yes. And not for money. What do you say now?”
“I don’t feel disposed to say much. Who is she?”
“Guess.”
“Do I know her?”
“Guess.”
“I am not going to guess, at five o’clock in the morning, with my
brains frying and sputtering in my head. if you want me to guess, you
must ask me to dinner.”
“Well then, I’ll tell you,” said Stryver, coming slowly into a sitting
posture. “Sydney, I rather despair of making myself intelligible to you,
because you are such an insensible dog.”
“And you,” returned Sydney, busy concocting the punch, “are such
a sensitive and poetical spirit—”
“Come!” rejoined Stryver, laughing boastfully, “though I don’t prefer any claim to being the soul of Romance (for I hope I know better),
still I am a tenderer sort of fellow than you.”
“You are a luckier, if you mean that.”
“I don’t mean that. I mean I am a man of more—more—”
“Say gallantry, while you are about it,” suggested Carton.
“Well! I’ll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,” said
Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, “who cares
more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows
better how to be agreeable, in a woman’s society, than you do.”
“Go on,” said Sydney Carton.
“No; but before I go on,” said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, I’ll have this out with you. You’ve been at Doctor Manette’s
house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been
ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that
silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have
been ashamed of you, Sydney¡‘
“It should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar,
121
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to be ashamed of anything,” returned Sydney; “you ought to be much
obliged to me.”
“You shall not get off in that way,” rejoined Stryver, shouldering the
rejoinder at him; “no, Sydney, it’s my duty to tell you—and I tell you to
your face to do you good—that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow
in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.”
Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed.
“Look at me!” said Stryver, squaring himself; “I have less need
to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in
circumstances. Why do I do it?”
“I never saw you do it yet,” muttered Carton.
“I do it because it’s politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I
get on.”
“You don’t get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,” answered Carton, with a careless air; “I wish you would keep to
that. As to me—will you never understand that I am incorrigible?”
He asked the question with some appearance of scorn.
“You have no business to be incorrigible,” was his friend’s answer,
delivered in no very soothing tone.
“I have no business to be, at all, that I know of,” said Sydney Carton.
“Who is the lady?”
“Now, don’t let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,” said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious
friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, “because I know
you don’t mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no
importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the
young lady to me in slighting terms.”
“I did?”
“Certainly; and in these chambers.”
Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent
friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.
“You made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The
young lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been
a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not.
You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when
I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man’s opinion
of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music
of mine, who had no ear for music.”
122
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers,
looking at his friend.
“Now you know all about it, Syd,” said Mr. Stryver. “I don’t care
about fortune: she is a charming creature, and I have made up my mind
to please myself: on the whole, I think I can afford to please myself. She
will have in me a man already pretty well off, and a rapidly rising man,
and a man of some distinction: it is a piece of good fortune for her, but
she is worthy of good fortune. Are you astonished?”
Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I be astonished?”
“You approve?”
Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, “Why should I not approve?”
“Well!” said his friend Stryver, “you take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought
you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time
that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I
have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it;
I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels
inclined to go to it (when he doesn’t, he can stay away), and I feel that
Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit.
So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say
a word to you about your prospects. You are in a bad way, you know;
you really are in a bad way. You don’t know the value of money, you
live hard, you’ll knock up one of these days, and be ill and poor; you
really ought to think about a nurse.”
The prosperous patronage with which he said it, made him look
twice as big as he was, and four times as offensive.
“Now, let me recommend you,” pursued Stryver, “to look it in the
face. I have looked it in the face, in my different way; look it in the
face, you, in your different way. Marry. Provide somebody to take care
of you. Never mind your having no enjoyment of women’s society, nor
understanding of it, nor tact for it. Find out somebody. Find out some
respectable woman with a little property—somebody in the landlady
way, or lodging-letting way—and marry her, against a rainy day. That’s
the kind of thing for you. Now think of it, Sydney.”
“I’ll think of it,” said Sydney.

Chapter 12
The Fellow of Delicacy
Mr. Stryver having made up his mind to that magnanimous bestowal of
good fortune on the Doctor’s daughter, resolved to make her happiness
known to her before he left town for the Long Vacation. After some
mental debating of the point, he came to the conclusion that it would
be as well to get all the preliminaries done with, and they could then arrange at their leisure whether he should give her his hand a week or two
before Michaelmas Term, or in the little Christmas vacation between it
and Hilary.
As to the strength of his case, he had not a doubt about it, but
clearly saw his way to the verdict. Argued with the jury on substantial
worldly grounds—the only grounds ever worth taking into account—it
was a plain case, and had not a weak spot in it. He called himself for
the plaintiff, there was no getting over his evidence, the counsel for the
defendant threw up his brief, and the jury did not even turn to consider.
After trying it, Stryver, C. J., was satisfied that no plainer case could be.
Accordingly, Mr. Stryver inaugurated the Long Vacation with a formal proposal to take Miss Manette to Vauxhall Gardens; that failing,
to Ranelagh; that unaccountably failing too, it behoved him to present
himself in Soho, and there declare his noble mind.
Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the
Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation’s infancy was still upon
it. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he
was yet on Saint Dunstan’s side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown
way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might
have seen how safe and strong he was.
His way taking him past Tellson’s, and he both banking at Tellson’s
and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered
Mr. Stryver’s mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak
rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where
Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron
bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything
under the clouds were a sum.
“Halloa!” said Mr. Stryver. “How do you do? I hope you are well!”
124
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It was Stryver’s grand peculiarity that he always seemed too big for
any place, or space. He was so much too big for Tellson’s, that old clerks
in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he
squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading
the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the
Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat.
The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would
recommend under the circumstances, “How do you do, Mr. Stryver?
How do you do, sir?” and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in
his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson’s
who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He
shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co.
“Can I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?” asked Mr. Lorry, in his
business character.
“Why, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I
have come for a private word.”
“Oh indeed!” said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye
strayed to the House afar off.
“I am going,” said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the
desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to
be not half desk enough for him: “I am going to make an offer of myself
in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.”
“Oh dear me!” cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his
visitor dubiously.
“Oh dear me, sir?” repeated Stryver, drawing back. “Oh dear you,
sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?”
“My meaning,” answered the man of business, “is, of course,
friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and—
in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But—really, you
know, Mr. Stryver—” Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him
in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add,
internally, “you know there really is so much too much of you!”
“Well!” said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand,
opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, “if I understand you,
Mr. Lorry, I’ll be hanged!”
Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards
that end, and bit the feather of a pen.
“D—n it all, sir!” said Stryver, staring at him, “am I not eligible?”
“Oh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you’re eligible!” said Mr. Lorry. “If you
125
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
say eligible, you are eligible.”
“Am I not prosperous?” asked Stryver.
“Oh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,” said Mr.
Lorry.
“And advancing?”
“If you come to advancing you know,” said Mr. Lorry, delighted to
be able to make another admission, “nobody can doubt that.”
“Then what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?” demanded
Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen.
“Well! I—Were you going there now?” asked Mr. Lorry.
“Straight!” said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk.
“Then I think I wouldn’t, if I was you.”
“Why?” said Stryver. “Now, I’ll put you in a corner,” forensically
shaking a forefinger at him. “You are a man of business and bound to
have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn’t you go?”
“Because,” said Mr. Lorry, “I wouldn’t go on such an object without
having some cause to believe that I should succeed.”
“D—n me!” cried Stryver, “but this beats everything.”
Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry
Stryver.
“Here’s a man of business—a man of years—a man of experience—
in a Bank,” said Stryver; “and having summed up three leading reasons
for complete success, he says there’s no reason at all! Says it with his
head on!” Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have
been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off.
“When I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady;
and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I
speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady.
The young lady, my good sir,” said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver
arm, “the young lady. The young lady goes before all.”
“Then you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,” said Stryver, squaring his
elbows, “that it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present
in question is a mincing Fool?”
“Not exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,” said Mr. Lorry,
reddening, “that I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady
from any lips; and that if I knew any man—which I hope I do not—
whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that
he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young
lady at this desk, not even Tellson’s should prevent my giving him a piece
126
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
of my mind.”
The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr.
Stryver’s blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to
be angry; Mr. Lorry’s veins, methodical as their courses could usually
be, were in no better state now it was his turn.
“That is what I mean to tell you, sir,” said Mr. Lorry. “Pray let there
be no mistake about it.”
Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then
stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him
the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying:
“This is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise
me not to go up to Soho and offer myself—myself, Stryver of the King’s
Bench bar?”
“Do you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?”
“Yes, I do.”
“Very good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.”
“And all I can say of it is,” laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, “that
this—ha, ha!—beats everything past, present, and to come.”
“Now understand me,” pursued Mr. Lorry. “As a man of business,
I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of
business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried
Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette
and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I
have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you
think I may not be right?”
“Not I!” said Stryver, whistling. “I can’t undertake to find third
parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in
certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It’s
new to me, but you are right, I dare say.”
“What I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself—
And understand me, sir,” said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, “I will
not—not even at Tellson’s—have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.”
“There! I beg your pardon!” said Stryver.
“Granted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:—it
might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful
to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might
be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with
you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness
127
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the
exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to
bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test
its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied
with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is
best spared. What do you say?”
“How long would you keep me in town?”
“Oh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the
evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.”
“Then I say yes,” said Stryver: “I won’t go up there now, I am not
so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look
in to-night. Good morning.”
Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a
concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of
the two ancient clerks. Those venerable and feeble persons were always
seen by the public in the act of bowing, and were popularly believed,
when they had bowed a customer out, still to keep on bowing in the
empty office until they bowed another customer in.
The barrister was keen enough to divine that the banker would not
have gone so far in his expression of opinion on any less solid ground
than moral certainty. Unprepared as he was for the large pill he had
to swallow, he got it down. “And now,” said Mr. Stryver, shaking his
forensic forefinger at the Temple in general, when it was down, “my
way out of this, is, to put you all in the wrong.”
It was a bit of the art of an Old Bailey tactician, in which he found
great relief. “You shall not put me in the wrong, young lady,” said Mr.
Stryver; “I’ll do that for you.”
Accordingly, when Mr. Lorry called that night as late as ten o’clock,
Mr. Stryver, among a quantity of books and papers littered out for the
purpose, seemed to have nothing less on his mind than the subject of
the morning. He even showed surprise when he saw Mr. Lorry, and was
altogether in an absent and preoccupied state.
“Well!” said that good-natured emissary, after a full half-hour of
bootless attempts to bring him round to the question. “I have been to
Soho.”
“To Soho?” repeated Mr. Stryver, coldly. “Oh, to be sure! What am
I thinking of!”
128
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“And I have no doubt,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was right in the conversation we had. My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.”
“I assure you,” returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, “that I
am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father’s
account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let
us say no more about it.”
“I don’t understand you,” said Mr. Lorry.
“I dare say not,” rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing
and final way; “no matter, no matter.”
“But it does matter,” Mr. Lorry urged.
“No it doesn’t; I assure you it doesn’t. Having supposed that there
was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there
is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm
is done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and
have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would
have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been
a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view—it is hardly necessary to
say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I
have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by
no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities
and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or
you will always be disappointed. Now, pray say no more about it. I
tell you, I regret it on account of others, but I am satisfied on my own
account. And I am really very much obliged to you for allowing me to
sound you, and for giving me your advice; you know the young lady
better than I do; you were right, it never would have done.”
Mr. Lorry was so taken aback, that he looked quite stupidly at Mr.
Stryver shouldering him towards the door, with an appearance of showering generosity, forbearance, and goodwill, on his erring head. “Make
the best of it, my dear sir,” said Stryver; “say no more about it; thank
you again for allowing me to sound you; good night!”
Mr. Lorry was out in the night, before he knew where he was. Mr.
Stryver was lying back on his sofa, winking at his ceiling.

Chapter 13
The Fellow of No Delicacy
If Sydney Carton ever shone anywhere, he certainly never shone in the
house of Doctor Manette. He had been there often, during a whole year,
and had always been the same moody and morose lounger there. When
he cared to talk, he talked well; but, the cloud of caring for nothing,
which overshadowed him with such a fatal darkness, was very rarely
pierced by the light within him.
And yet he did care something for the streets that environed that
house, and for the senseless stones that made their pavements. Many a
night he vaguely and unhappily wandered there, when wine had brought
no transitory gladness to him; many a dreary daybreak revealed his solitary figure lingering there, and still lingering there when the first beams
of the sun brought into strong relief, removed beauties of architecture in
spires of churches and lofty buildings, as perhaps the quiet time brought
some sense of better things, else forgotten and unattainable, into his
mind. Of late, the neglected bed in the Temple Court had known him
more scantily than ever; and often when he had thrown himself upon
it no longer than a few minutes, he had got up again, and haunted that
neighbourhood.
On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal
that “he had thought better of that marrying matter”) had carried his
delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the
City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health
for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney’s feet still trod those
stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated
by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him
to the Doctor’s door.
He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She
had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some
little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking
up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she
observed a change in it.
“I fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!”
“No. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health.
What is to be expected of, or by, such profligates?”
130
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Is it not—forgive me; I have begun the question on my lips—a pity
to live no better life?”
“God knows it is a shame!”
“Then why not change it?”
Looking gently at him again, she was surprised and saddened to see
that there were tears in his eyes. There were tears in his voice too, as he
answered:
“It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink
lower, and be worse.”
He leaned an elbow on her table, and covered his eyes with his hand.
The table trembled in the silence that followed.
She had never seen him softened, and was much distressed. He knew
her to be so, without looking at her, and said:
“Pray forgive me, Miss Manette. I break down before the knowledge
of what I want to say to you. Will you hear me?”
“If it will do you any good, Mr. Carton, if it would make you happier,
it would make me very glad!”
“God bless you for your sweet compassion!”
He unshaded his face after a little while, and spoke steadily.
“Don’t be afraid to hear me. Don’t shrink from anything I say. I am
like one who died young. All my life might have been.”
“No, Mr. Carton. I am sure that the best part of it might still be; I
am sure that you might be much, much worthier of yourself.”
“Say of you, Miss Manette, and although I know better—although
in the mystery of my own wretched heart I know better—I shall never
forget it!”
She was pale and trembling. He came to her relief with a fixed
despair of himself which made the interview unlike any other that could
have been holden.
“If it had been possible, Miss Manette, that you could have returned the love of the man you see before yourself—flung away, wasted,
drunken, poor creature of misuse as you know him to be—he would
have been conscious this day and hour, in spite of his happiness, that he
would bring you to misery, bring you to sorrow and repentance, blight
you, disgrace you, pull you down with him. I know very well that you
can have no tenderness for me; I ask for none; I am even thankful that
it cannot be.”
“Without it, can I not save you, Mr. Carton? Can I not recall you—
forgive me again!—to a better course? Can I in no way repay your
131
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
confidence? I know this is a confidence,” she modestly said, after a little
hesitation, and in earnest tears, “I know you would say this to no one
else. Can I turn it to no good account for yourself, Mr. Carton?”
He shook his head.
“To none. No, Miss Manette, to none. If you will hear me through a
very little more, all you can ever do for me is done. I wish you to know
that you have been the last dream of my soul. In my degradation I have
not been so degraded but that the sight of you with your father, and
of this home made such a home by you, has stirred old shadows that I
thought had died out of me. Since I knew you, I have been troubled by a
remorse that I thought would never reproach me again, and have heard
whispers from old voices impelling me upward, that I thought were
silent for ever. I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning
anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned
fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper
where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.”
“Will nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!”
“No, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite
undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled
me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire—a fire, however, inseparable in
its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no
service, idly burning away.”
“Since it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more
unhappy than you were before you knew me—”
“Don’t say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if
anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.”
“Since the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events,
attributable to some influence of mine—this is what I mean, if I can
make it plain—can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for
good, with you, at all?”
“The utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have
come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected
life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the
world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you
could deplore and pity.”
“Which I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently,
with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!”
“Entreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved
132
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will
you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my
life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there
alone, and will be shared by no one?”
“If that will be a consolation to you, yes.”
“Not even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?”
“Mr. Carton,” she answered, after an agitated pause, “the secret is
yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.”
“Thank you. And again, God bless you.”
He put her hand to his lips, and moved towards the door.
“Be under no apprehension, Miss Manette, of my ever resuming this
conversation by so much as a passing word. I will never refer to it again.
If I were dead, that could not be surer than it is henceforth. In the hour
of my death, I shall hold sacred the one good remembrance—and shall
thank and bless you for it—that my last avowal of myself was made to
you, and that my name, and faults, and miseries were gently carried in
your heart. May it otherwise be light and happy!”
He was so unlike what he had ever shown himself to be, and it was
so sad to think how much he had thrown away, and how much he every
day kept down and perverted, that Lucie Manette wept mournfully for
him as he stood looking back at her.
“Be comforted!” he said, “I am not worth such feeling, Miss
Manette. An hour or two hence, and the low companions and low
habits that I scorn but yield to, will render me less worth such tears as
those, than any wretch who creeps along the streets. Be comforted! But,
within myself, I shall always be, towards you, what I am now, though
outwardly I shall be what you have heretofore seen me. The last supplication but one I make to you, is, that you will believe this of me.”
“I will, Mr. Carton.”
“My last supplication of all, is this; and with it, I will relieve you
of a visitor with whom I well know you have nothing in unison, and
between whom and you there is an impassable space. It is useless to
say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear
to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that
there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace
any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your
mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The
time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will
be formed about you—ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and
133
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
strongly to the home you so adorn—the dearest ties that will ever grace
and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy
father’s face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty
springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man
who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”
He said, “Farewell!” said a last “God bless you!” and left her.
Chapter 14
The Honest Tradesman
To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street
with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects
in movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything
in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and
deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with
the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending
to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes
down!
With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two
streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on
duty watching one stream—saving that Jerry had no expectation of their
ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful
kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of
timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life)
from Tellson’s side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to
become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have
the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts
bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose,
that he recruited his finances, as just now observed.
Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused
in the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place,
but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him.
It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were
few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so
unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs.
Cruncher must have been “flopping” in some pointed manner, when an
134
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his
attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of
funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this
funeral, which engendered uproar.
“Young Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, “it’s a
buryin’.”
“Hooroar, father!” cried Young Jerry.
The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious
significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched
his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear.
“What d’ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want
to conwey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting
too many for me!” said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. “Him and his
hooroars! Don’t let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some
more of me. D’ye hear?”
“I warn’t doing no harm,” Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek.
“Drop it then,” said Mr. Cruncher; “I won’t have none of your no
harms. Get a top of that there seat, and look at the crowd.”
His son obeyed, and the crowd approached; they were bawling
and hissing round a dingy hearse and dingy mourning coach, in which
mourning coach there was only one mourner, dressed in the dingy trappings that were considered essential to the dignity of the position. The
position appeared by no means to please him, however, with an increasing rabble surrounding the coach, deriding him, making grimaces at
him, and incessantly groaning and calling out: “Yah! Spies! Tst! Yaha!
Spies!” with many compliments too numerous and forcible to repeat.
Funerals had at all times a remarkable attraction for Mr. Cruncher;
he always pricked up his senses, and became excited, when a funeral
passed Tellson’s. Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon
attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran
against him:
“What is it, brother? What’s it about?”
“I don’t know,” said the man. “Spies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!”
He asked another man. “Who is it?”
“I don’t know,” returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth
nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest
ardour, “Spies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi—ies!”
At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was
135
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the funeral of one Roger Cly.
“Was He a spy?” asked Mr. Cruncher.
“Old Bailey spy,” returned his informant. “Yaha! Tst! Yah! Old
Bailey Spi—i—ies!”
“Why, to be sure!” exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he
had assisted. “I’ve seen him. Dead, is he?”
“Dead as mutton,” returned the other, “and can’t be too dead. Have
’em out, there! Spies! Pull ’em out, there! Spies!”
The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that
the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have ’em out, and to pull ’em out, mobbed the two vehicles so
closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd’s opening the coach
doors, the one mourner scuffled out of himself and was in their hands
for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time,
that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after
shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and
other symbolical tears.
These, the people tore to pieces and scattered far and wide with
great enjoyment, while the tradesmen hurriedly shut up their shops; for
a crowd in those times stopped at nothing, and was a monster much
dreaded. They had already got the length of opening the hearse to take
the coffin out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being
escorted to its destination amidst general rejoicing. Practical suggestions
being much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation,
and the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. Among the first of these volunteers
was Jerry Cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head
from the observation of Tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning
coach.
The officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes
in the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several
voices remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and
brief. The remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the hearse—advised by the regular driver, who was perched beside
him, under close inspection, for the purpose—and with a pieman, also
attended by his cabinet minister, driving the mourning coach. A bearleader, a popular street character of the time, was impressed as an ad136
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ditional ornament, before the cavalcade had gone far down the Strand;
and his bear, who was black and very mangy, gave quite an Undertaking
air to that part of the procession in which he walked.
Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite
caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting
at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination
was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there
in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally,
accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way,
and highly to its own satisfaction.
The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity
of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual
passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase
was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been
near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and
they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of
window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was
easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summerhouses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up,
to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards
were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and
perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was
the usual progress of a mob.
Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained
behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers.
The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from
a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings
and maturely considering the spot.
“Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way,
“you see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he
was a young ’un and a straight made ’un.”
Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned
himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his
station at Tellson’s. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched
his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss,
or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not
so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical
adviser—a distinguished surgeon—on his way back.
137
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported
No job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out,
the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to
tea.
“Now, I tell you where it is!” said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on
entering. “If, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night,
I shall make sure that you’ve been praying again me, and I shall work
you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.”
The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head.
“Why, you’re at it afore my face!” said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of
angry apprehension.
“I am saying nothing.”
“Well, then; don’t meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.”
“Yes, Jerry.”
“Yes, Jerry,” repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. “Ah! It is
yes, Jerry. That’s about it. You may say yes, Jerry.”
Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express
general ironical dissatisfaction.
“You and your yes, Jerry,” said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of
his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible
oyster out of his saucer. “Ah! I think so. I believe you.”
“You are going out to-night?” asked his decent wife, when he took
another bite.
“Yes, I am.”
“May I go with you, father?” asked his son, briskly.
“No, you mayn’t. I’m a going—as your mother knows—a fishing.
That’s where I’m going to. Going a fishing.”
“Your fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don’t it, father?”
“Never you mind.”
“Shall you bring any fish home, father?”
“If I don’t, you’ll have short commons, to-morrow,” returned that
gentleman, shaking his head; “that’s questions enough for you; I ain’t a
going out, till you’ve been long abed.”
He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping
a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in
conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions
138
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling
on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he
would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest
prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife. It was as if a professed
unbeliever in ghosts should be frightened by a ghost story.
“And mind you!” said Mr. Cruncher. “No games to-morrow! If
I, as a honest tradesman, succeed in providing a jinte of meat or two,
none of your not touching of it, and sticking to bread. If I, as a honest
tradesman, am able to provide a little beer, none of your declaring on
water. When you go to Rome, do as Rome does. Rome will be a ugly
customer to you, if you don’t. I’m your Rome, you know.”
Then he began grumbling again:
“With your flying into the face of your own wittles and drink! I
don’t know how scarce you mayn’t make the wittles and drink here, by
your flopping tricks and your unfeeling conduct. Look at your boy: he
is your’n, ain’t he? He’s as thin as a lath. Do you call yourself a mother,
and not know that a mother’s first duty is to blow her boy out?”
This touched Young Jerry on a tender place; who adjured his mother
to perform her first duty, and, whatever else she did or neglected, above
all things to lay especial stress on the discharge of that maternal function
so affectingly and delicately indicated by his other parent.
Thus the evening wore away with the Cruncher family, until Young
Jerry was ordered to bed, and his mother, laid under similar injunctions,
obeyed them. Mr. Cruncher beguiled the earlier watches of the night
with solitary pipes, and did not start upon his excursion until nearly
one o’clock. Towards that small and ghostly hour, he rose up from his
chair, took a key out of his pocket, opened a locked cupboard, and
brought forth a sack, a crowbar of convenient size, a rope and chain,
and other fishing tackle of that nature. Disposing these articles about
him in skilful manner, he bestowed a parting defiance on Mrs. Cruncher,
extinguished the light, and went out.
Young Jerry, who had only made a feint of undressing when he went
to bed, was not long after his father. Under cover of the darkness he
followed out of the room, followed down the stairs, followed down the
court, followed out into the streets. He was in no uneasiness concerning
his getting into the house again, for it was full of lodgers, and the door
stood ajar all night.
139
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Impelled by a laudable ambition to study the art and mystery of his
father’s honest calling, Young Jerry, keeping as close to house fronts,
walls, and doorways, as his eyes were close to one another, held his honoured parent in view. The honoured parent steering Northward, had
not gone far, when he was joined by another disciple of Izaak Walton,
and the two trudged on together.
Within half an hour from the first starting, they were beyond the
winking lamps, and the more than winking watchmen, and were out
upon a lonely road. Another fisherman was picked up here—and that
so silently, that if Young Jerry had been superstitious, he might have
supposed the second follower of the gentle craft to have, all of a sudden,
split himself into two.
The three went on, and Young Jerry went on, until the three stopped
under a bank overhanging the road. Upon the top of the bank was
a low brick wall, surmounted by an iron railing. In the shadow of
bank and wall the three turned out of the road, and up a blind lane, of
which the wall—there, risen to some eight or ten feet high—formed one
side. Crouching down in a corner, peeping up the lane, the next object
that Young Jerry saw, was the form of his honoured parent, pretty well
defined against a watery and clouded moon, nimbly scaling an iron gate.
He was soon over, and then the second fisherman got over, and then the
third. They all dropped softly on the ground within the gate, and lay
there a little—listening perhaps. Then, they moved away on their hands
and knees.
It was now Young Jerry’s turn to approach the gate: which he did,
holding his breath. Crouching down again in a corner there, and looking in, he made out the three fishermen creeping through some rank
grass! and all the gravestones in the churchyard—it was a large churchyard that they were in—looking on like ghosts in white, while the
church tower itself looked on like the ghost of a monstrous giant. They
did not creep far, before they stopped and stood upright. And then they
began to fish.
They fished with a spade, at first. Presently the honoured parent
appeared to be adjusting some instrument like a great corkscrew. Whatever tools they worked with, they worked hard, until the awful striking
of the church clock so terrified Young Jerry, that he made off, with his
hair as stiff as his father’s.
But, his long-cherished desire to know more about these matters,
not only stopped him in his running away, but lured him back again.
140
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
They were still fishing perseveringly, when he peeped in at the gate for
the second time; but, now they seemed to have got a bite. There was
a screwing and complaining sound down below, and their bent figures
were strained, as if by a weight. By slow degrees the weight broke away
the earth upon it, and came to the surface. Young Jerry very well knew
what it would be; but, when he saw it, and saw his honoured parent
about to wrench it open, he was so frightened, being new to the sight,
that he made off again, and never stopped until he had run a mile or
more.
He would not have stopped then, for anything less necessary than
breath, it being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and one highly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that the coffin he had seen
was running after him; and, pictured as hopping on behind him, bolt upright, upon its narrow end, always on the point of overtaking him and
hopping on at his side—perhaps taking his arm—it was a pursuer to
shun. It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was
making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the
roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them
like a dropsical boy’s-Kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways
too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up
to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and
lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly
hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his
own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would
not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair,
scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on
his breast when he fell asleep.
From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened
after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the
family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young
Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by
the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of
the bed.
“I told you I would,” said Mr. Cruncher, “and I did.”
“Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!” his wife implored.
“You oppose yourself to the profit of the business,” said Jerry, “and
me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil
don’t you?”
“I try to be a good wife, Jerry,” the poor woman protested, with
141
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
tears.
“Is it being a good wife to oppose your husband’s business? Is it
honouring your husband to dishonour his business? Is it obeying your
husband to disobey him on the wital subject of his business?”
“You hadn’t taken to the dreadful business then, Jerry.”
“It’s enough for you,” retorted Mr. Cruncher, “to be the wife of a
honest tradesman, and not to occupy your female mind with calculations when he took to his trade or when he didn’t. A honouring and
obeying wife would let his trade alone altogether. Call yourself a religious woman? If you’re a religious woman, give me a irreligious one!
You have no more nat’ral sense of duty than the bed of this here Thames
river has of a pile, and similarly it must be knocked into you.”
The altercation was conducted in a low tone of voice, and terminated in the honest tradesman’s kicking off his clay-soiled boots, and
lying down at his length on the floor. After taking a timid peep at him
lying on his back, with his rusty hands under his head for a pillow, his
son lay down too, and fell asleep again.
There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr.
Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron potlid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case
he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed
and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his
ostensible calling.
Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father’s
side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young
Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness
and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day,
and his qualms were gone with the night—in which particulars it is not
improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London,
that fine morning.
“Father,” said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to
keep at arm’s length and to have the stool well between them: “what’s
a Resurrection-Man?”
Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered,
“How should I know?”
“I thought you knowed everything, father,” said the artless boy.
“Hem! Well,” returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting
off his hat to give his spikes free play, “he’s a tradesman.”
“What’s his goods, father?” asked the brisk Young Jerry.
142
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“His goods,” said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind,
“is a branch of Scientific goods.”
“Persons’ bodies, ain’t it, father?” asked the lively boy.
“I believe it is something of that sort,” said Mr. Cruncher.
“Oh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I’m
quite growed up!”
Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and
moral way. “It depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can
help to nobody, and there’s no telling at the present time what you may
not come to be fit for.” As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a
few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr.
Cruncher added to himself: “Jerry, you honest tradesman, there’s hopes
wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for
his mother!”
Chapter 15
Knitting
There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur
Defarge. As early as six o’clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping
through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending
over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the
best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine
that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its
influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy.
No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of
Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay
hidden in the dregs of it.
This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had
been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun
on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of
early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered
and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who
could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.
These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could
have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to
143
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with
greedy looks.
Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the
wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed
the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered
to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution
of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of
humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.
A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps
observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in
at every place, high and low, from the kings palace to the criminal’s gaol.
Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers
with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine,
Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her
toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long
way off.
Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It
was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and
under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the
other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two
entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the
breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred
and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one
had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop,
though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them.
“Good day, gentlemen!” said Monsieur Defarge.
It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited
an answering chorus of “Good day!”
“It is bad weather, gentlemen,” said Defarge, shaking his head.
Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast
down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went
out.
“My wife,” said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: “I
have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called
Jacques. I met him—by accident—a day and half’s journey out of Paris.
He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to
drink, my wife!”
A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine
144
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to
the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some
coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and
drinking near Madame Defarge’s counter. A third man got up and went
out.
Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine—but, he took less
than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no
rarity—and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast.
He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even
Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work.
“Have you finished your repast, friend?” he asked, in due season.
“Yes, thank you.”
“Come, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could
occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.”
Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into
a garret,—formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low
bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.
No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there
who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the
white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once
looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.
Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice:
“Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all.
Speak, Jacques Five!”
The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead
with it, and said, “Where shall I commence, monsieur?”
“Commence,” was Monsieur Defarge’s not unreasonable reply, “at
the commencement.”
“I saw him then, messieurs,” began the mender of roads, “a year ago
this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging
by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road,
the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the
hill, he hanging by the chain—like this.”
Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in
which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been
the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.
145
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before?
“Never,” answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular.
Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?
“By his tall figure,” said the mender of roads, softly, and with his
finger at his nose. “When Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening,
’Say, what is he like?’ I make response, ‘Tall as a spectre.’ ”
“You should have said, short as a dwarf,” returned Jacques Two.
“But what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither
did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do
not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his
finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, ‘To me! Bring that
rascal!’ My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.”
“He is right there, Jacques,” murmured Defarge, to him who had
interrupted. “Go on!”
“Good!” said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery. “The tall
man is lost, and he is sought—how many months? Nine, ten, eleven?”
“No matter, the number,” said Defarge. “He is well hidden, but at
last he is unluckily found. Go on!”
“I am again at work upon the hill-side, and the sun is again about
to go to bed. I am collecting my tools to descend to my cottage down
in the village below, where it is already dark, when I raise my eyes, and
see coming over the hill six soldiers. In the midst of them is a tall man
with his arms bound—tied to his sides—like this!”
With the aid of his indispensable cap, he represented a man with his
elbows bound fast at his hips, with cords that were knotted behind him.
“I stand aside, messieurs, by my heap of stones, to see the soldiers
and their prisoner pass (for it is a solitary road, that, where any spectacle
is well worth looking at), and at first, as they approach, I see no more
than that they are six soldiers with a tall man bound, and that they
are almost black to my sight—except on the side of the sun going to
bed, where they have a red edge, messieurs. Also, I see that their long
shadows are on the hollow ridge on the opposite side of the road, and
are on the hill above it, and are like the shadows of giants. Also, I see
that they are covered with dust, and that the dust moves with them as
they come, tramp, tramp! But when they advance quite near to me, I
recognise the tall man, and he recognises me. Ah, but he would be well
content to precipitate himself over the hill-side once again, as on the
evening when he and I first encountered, close to the same spot!”
146
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He described it as if he were there, and it was evident that he saw it
vividly; perhaps he had not seen much in his life.
“I do not show the soldiers that I recognise the tall man; he does
not show the soldiers that he recognises me; we do it, and we know
it, with our eyes. ‘Come on!’ says the chief of that company, pointing
to the village, ‘bring him fast to his tomb!’ and they bring him faster.
I follow. His arms are swelled because of being bound so tight, his
wooden shoes are large and clumsy, and he is lame. Because he is lame,
and consequently slow, they drive him with their guns—like this!”
He imitated the action of a man’s being impelled forward by the
butt-ends of muskets.
“As they descend the hill like madmen running a race, he falls. They
laugh and pick him up again. His face is bleeding and covered with
dust, but he cannot touch it; thereupon they laugh again. They bring
him into the village; all the village runs to look; they take him past the
mill, and up to the prison; all the village sees the prison gate open in the
darkness of the night, and swallow him—like this!”
He opened his mouth as wide as he could, and shut it with a sounding snap of his teeth. Observant of his unwillingness to mar the effect
by opening it again, Defarge said, “Go on, Jacques.”
“All the village,” pursued the mender of roads, on tiptoe and in a
low voice, “withdraws; all the village whispers by the fountain; all the
village sleeps; all the village dreams of that unhappy one, within the
locks and bars of the prison on the crag, and never to come out of
it, except to perish. In the morning, with my tools upon my shoulder,
eating my morsel of black bread as I go, I make a circuit by the prison,
on my way to my work. There I see him, high up, behind the bars of a
lofty iron cage, bloody and dusty as last night, looking through. He has
no hand free, to wave to me; I dare not call to him; he regards me like a
dead man.”
Defarge and the three glanced darkly at one another. The looks of
all of them were dark, repressed, and revengeful, as they listened to the
countryman’s story; the manner of all of them, while it was secret, was
authoritative too. They had the air of a rough tribunal; Jacques One and
Two sitting on the old pallet-bed, each with his chin resting on his hand,
and his eyes intent on the road-mender; Jacques Three, equally intent,
on one knee behind them, with his agitated hand always gliding over
the network of fine nerves about his mouth and nose; Defarge standing
between them and the narrator, whom he had stationed in the light of
147
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the window, by turns looking from him to them, and from them to him.
“Go on, Jacques,” said Defarge.
“He remains up there in his iron cage some days. The village looks
at him by stealth, for it is afraid. But it always looks up, from a distance,
at the prison on the crag; and in the evening, when the work of the day is
achieved and it assembles to gossip at the fountain, all faces are turned
towards the prison. Formerly, they were turned towards the postinghouse; now, they are turned towards the prison. They whisper at the
fountain, that although condemned to death he will not be executed;
they say that petitions have been presented in Paris, showing that he
was enraged and made mad by the death of his child; they say that a
petition has been presented to the King himself. What do I know? It is
possible. Perhaps yes, perhaps no.”
“Listen then, Jacques,” Number One of that name sternly interposed. “Know that a petition was presented to the King and Queen.
All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the
street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who,
at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition
in his hand.”
“And once again listen, Jacques!” said the kneeling Number Three:
his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something—that was neither food
nor drink; “the guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and
struck him blows. You hear?”
“I hear, messieurs.”
“Go on then,” said Defarge.
“Again; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,” resumed
the countryman, “that he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They
even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants—serfs—what you will—he will be
executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right
hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into
wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there
will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That
old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if
he lies? I am not a scholar.”
148
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Listen once again then, Jacques!” said the man with the restless
hand and the craving air. “The name of that prisoner was Damiens,
and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris;
and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done,
than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last—to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall,
when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed! And it was
done—why, how old are you?”
“Thirty-five,” said the mender of roads, who looked sixty.
“It was done when you were more than ten years old; you might
have seen it.”
“Enough!” said Defarge, with grim impatience. “Long live the
Devil! Go on.”
“Well! Some whisper this, some whisper that; they speak of nothing
else; even the fountain appears to fall to that tune. At length, on Sunday
night when all the village is asleep, come soldiers, winding down from
the prison, and their guns ring on the stones of the little street. Workmen
dig, workmen hammer, soldiers laugh and sing; in the morning, by the
fountain, there is raised a gallows forty feet high, poisoning the water.”
The mender of roads looked through rather than at the low ceiling,
and pointed as if he saw the gallows somewhere in the sky.
“All work is stopped, all assemble there, nobody leads the cows out,
the cows are there with the rest. At midday, the roll of drums. Soldiers
have marched into the prison in the night, and he is in the midst of many
soldiers. He is bound as before, and in his mouth there is a gag—tied
so, with a tight string, making him look almost as if he laughed.” He
suggested it, by creasing his face with his two thumbs, from the corners
of his mouth to his ears. “On the top of the gallows is fixed the knife,
blade upwards, with its point in the air. He is hanged there forty feet
high—and is left hanging, poisoning the water.”
They looked at one another, as he used his blue cap to wipe his
face, on which the perspiration had started afresh while he recalled the
spectacle.
“It is frightful, messieurs. How can the women and the children
draw water! Who can gossip of an evening, under that shadow! Under
it, have I said? When I left the village, Monday evening as the sun was
going to bed, and looked back from the hill, the shadow struck across
the church, across the mill, across the prison—seemed to strike across
the earth, messieurs, to where the sky rests upon it!”
149
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The hungry man gnawed one of his fingers as he looked at the other
three, and his finger quivered with the craving that was on him.
“That’s all, messieurs. I left at sunset (as I had been warned to do),
and I walked on, that night and half next day, until I met (as I was
warned I should) this comrade. With him, I came on, now riding and
now walking, through the rest of yesterday and through last night. And
here you see me!”
After a gloomy silence, the first Jacques said, “Good! You have
acted and recounted faithfully. Will you wait for us a little, outside the
door?”
“Very willingly,” said the mender of roads. Whom Defarge escorted
to the top of the stairs, and, leaving seated there, returned.
The three had risen, and their heads were together when he came
back to the garret.
“How say you, Jacques?” demanded Number One. “To be registered?”
“To be registered, as doomed to destruction,” returned Defarge.
“Magnificent!” croaked the man with the craving.
“The chateau, and all the race?” inquired the first.
“The chateau and all the race,” returned Defarge. “Extermination.”
The hungry man repeated, in a rapturous croak, “Magnificent!” and
began gnawing another finger.
“Are you sure,” asked Jacques Two, of Defarge, “that no embarrassment can arise from our manner of keeping the register? Without
doubt it is safe, for no one beyond ourselves can decipher it; but shall
we always be able to decipher it—or, I ought to say, will she?”
“Jacques,” returned Defarge, drawing himself up, “if madame my
wife undertook to keep the register in her memory alone, she would not
lose a word of it—not a syllable of it. Knitted, in her own stitches and
her own symbols, it will always be as plain to her as the sun. Confide in
Madame Defarge. It would be easier for the weakest poltroon that lives,
to erase himself from existence, than to erase one letter of his name or
crimes from the knitted register of Madame Defarge.”
There was a murmur of confidence and approval, and then the man
who hungered, asked: “Is this rustic to be sent back soon? I hope so.
He is very simple; is he not a little dangerous?”
“He knows nothing,” said Defarge; “at least nothing more than
would easily elevate himself to a gallows of the same height. I charge
myself with him; let him remain with me; I will take care of him, and set
150
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
him on his road. He wishes to see the fine world—the King, the Queen,
and Court; let him see them on Sunday.”
“What?” exclaimed the hungry man, staring. “Is it a good sign, that
he wishes to see Royalty and Nobility?”
“Jacques,” said Defarge; “judiciously show a cat milk, if you wish
her to thirst for it. Judiciously show a dog his natural prey, if you wish
him to bring it down one day.”
Nothing more was said, and the mender of roads, being found already dozing on the topmost stair, was advised to lay himself down on
the pallet-bed and take some rest. He needed no persuasion, and was
soon asleep.
Worse quarters than Defarge’s wine-shop, could easily have been
found in Paris for a provincial slave of that degree. Saving for a mysterious dread of madame by which he was constantly haunted, his life
was very new and agreeable. But, madame sat all day at her counter,
so expressly unconscious of him, and so particularly determined not to
perceive that his being there had any connection with anything below
the surface, that he shook in his wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted
on her. For, he contended with himself that it was impossible to foresee
what that lady might pretend next; and he felt assured that if she should
take it into her brightly ornamented head to pretend that she had seen
him do a murder and afterwards flay the victim, she would infallibly go
through with it until the play was played out.
Therefore, when Sunday came, the mender of roads was not enchanted (though he said he was) to find that madame was to accompany
monsieur and himself to Versailles. It was additionally disconcerting to
have madame knitting all the way there, in a public conveyance; it was
additionally disconcerting yet, to have madame in the crowd in the afternoon, still with her knitting in her hands as the crowd waited to see
the carriage of the King and Queen.
“You work hard, madame,” said a man near her.
“Yes,” answered Madame Defarge; “I have a good deal to do.”
“What do you make, madame?”
“Many things.”
“For instance—”
“For instance,” returned Madame Defarge, composedly, “shrouds.”
The man moved a little further away, as soon as he could, and the
mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily
close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he
151
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
was fortunate in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced
King and the fair-faced Queen came in their golden coach, attended by
the shining Bull’s Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing
ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour
and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both
sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long
live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous
Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull’s Eye,more lords
and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours,
he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and
throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from
flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.
“Bravo!” said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over,
like a patron; “you are a good boy!”
The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no.
“You are the fellow we want,” said Defarge, in his ear; “you make
these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more
insolent, and it is the nearer ended.”
“Hey!” cried the mender of roads, reflectively; “that’s true.”
“These fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and
would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather
than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your
breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot
deceive them too much.”
Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in
confirmation.
“As to you,” said she, “you would shout and shed tears for anything,
if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?”
“Truly, madame, I think so. For the moment.”
“If you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them
to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you
would pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?”
“Truly yes, madame.”
“Yes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were
set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage,
152
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?”
“It is true, madame.”
“You have seen both dolls and birds to-day,” said Madame Defarge,
with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been
apparent; “now, go home!”
Chapter 16
Still Knitting
Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the
bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the
darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by
the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where
the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the
whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows
who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn,
strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase,
had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces
was altered. A rumour just lived in the village—had a faint and bare
existence there, as its people had—that when the knife struck home, the
faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that
when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain,
they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they
would henceforth bear for ever. In the stone face over the great window of the bed-chamber where the murder was done, two fine dints
were pointed out in the sculptured nose, which everybody recognised,
and which nobody had seen of old; and on the scarce occasions when
two or three ragged peasants emerged from the crowd to take a hurried
peep at Monsieur the Marquis petrified, a skinny finger would not have
pointed to it for a minute, before they all started away among the moss
and leaves, like the more fortunate hares who could find a living there.
Chateau and hut, stone face and dangling figure, the red stain on the
stone floor, and the pure water in the village well—thousands of acres
of land—a whole province of France—all France itself—lay under the
night sky, concentrated into a faint hair-breadth line. So does a whole
world, with all its greatnesses and littlenesses, lie in a twinkling star.
153
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
And as mere human knowledge can split a ray of light and analyse the
manner of its composition, so, sublimer intelligences may read in the
feeble shining of this earth of ours, every thought and act, every vice
and virtue, of every responsible creature on it.
The Defarges, husband and wife, came lumbering under the starlight,
in their public vehicle, to that gate of Paris whereunto their journey naturally tended. There was the usual stoppage at the barrier guardhouse,
and the usual lanterns came glancing forth for the usual examination
and inquiry. Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the
soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate with,
and affectionately embraced.
When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky
wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint’s boundaries, were
picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets,
Madame Defarge spoke to her husband:
“Say then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?”
“Very little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he can say,
but he knows of one.”
“Eh well!” said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool
business air. “It is necessary to register him. How do they call that
man?”
“He is English.”
“So much the better. His name?”
“Barsad,” said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he
had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect
correctness.
“Barsad,” repeated madame. “Good. Christian name?”
“John.”
“John Barsad,” repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. “Good. His appearance; is it known?”
“Age, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin,
long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.”
“Eh my faith. It is a portrait!” said madame, laughing. “He shall be
registered to-morrow.”
They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her
154
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence,
examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other
entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and
finally dismissed him to bed. Then she turned out the contents of the
bowl of money for the second time, and began knotting them up in her
handkerchief, in a chain of separate knots, for safe keeping through the
night. All this while, Defarge, with his pipe in his mouth, walked up
and down, complacently admiring, but never interfering; in which condition, indeed, as to the business and his domestic affairs, he walked up
and down through life.
The night was hot, and the shop, close shut and surrounded by so
foul a neighbourhood, was ill-smelling. Monsieur Defarge’s olfactory
sense was by no means delicate, but the stock of wine smelt much
stronger than it ever tasted, and so did the stock of rum and brandy
and aniseed. He whiffed the compound of scents away, as he put down
his smoked-out pipe.
“You are fatigued,” said madame, raising her glance as she knotted
the money. “There are only the usual odours.”
“I am a little tired,” her husband acknowledged.
“You are a little depressed, too,” said madame, whose quick eyes
had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two
for him. “Oh, the men, the men!”
“But my dear!” began Defarge.
“But my dear!” repeated madame, nodding firmly; “but my dear!
You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!”
“Well, then,” said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his
breast, “it is a long time.”
“It is a long time,” repeated his wife; “and when is it not a long
time? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.”
“It does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,” said
Defarge.
“How long,” demanded madame, composedly, “does it take to
make and store the lightning? Tell me.”
Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in
that too.
“It does not take a long time,” said madame, “for an earthquake
to swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the
earthquake?”
“A long time, I suppose,” said Defarge.
155
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“But when it is ready, it takes place, and grinds to pieces everything
before it. In the meantime, it is always preparing, though it is not seen
or heard. That is your consolation. Keep it.”
She tied a knot with flashing eyes, as if it throttled a foe.
“I tell thee,” said madame, extending her right hand, for emphasis,
“that although it is a long time on the road, it is on the road and coming. I tell thee it never retreats, and never stops. I tell thee it is always
advancing. Look around and consider the lives of all the world that we
know, consider the faces of all the world that we know, consider the
rage and discontent to which the Jacquerie addresses itself with more
and more of certainty every hour. Can such things last? Bah! I mock
you.”
“My brave wife,” returned Defarge, standing before her with his
head a little bent, and his hands clasped at his back, like a docile and
attentive pupil before his catechist, “I do not question all this. But it
has lasted a long time, and it is possible—you know well, my wife, it is
possible—that it may not come, during our lives.”
“Eh well! How then?” demanded madame, tying another knot, as
if there were another enemy strangled.
“Well!” said Defarge, with a half complaining and half apologetic
shrug. “We shall not see the triumph.”
“We shall have helped it,” returned madame, with her extended
hand in strong action. “Nothing that we do, is done in vain. I believe,
with all my soul, that we shall see the triumph. But even if not, even if
I knew certainly not, show me the neck of an aristocrat and tyrant, and
still I would—”
Then madame, with her teeth set, tied a very terrible knot indeed.
“Hold!” cried Defarge, reddening a little as if he felt charged with
cowardice; “I too, my dear, will stop at nothing.”
“Yes! But it is your weakness that you sometimes need to see your
victim and your opportunity, to sustain you. Sustain yourself without
that. When the time comes, let loose a tiger and a devil; but wait for
the time with the tiger and the devil chained—not shown—yet always
ready.”
Madame enforced the conclusion of this piece of advice by striking her little counter with her chain of money as if she knocked its
brains out, and then gathering the heavy handkerchief under her arm in
a serene manner, and observing that it was time to go to bed.
Next noontide saw the admirable woman in her usual place in the
156
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
wine-shop, knitting away assiduously. A rose lay beside her, and if she
now and then glanced at the flower, it was with no infraction of her
usual preoccupied air. There were a few customers, drinking or not
drinking, standing or seated, sprinkled about. The day was very hot,
and heaps of flies, who were extending their inquisitive and adventurous
perquisitions into all the glutinous little glasses near madame, fell dead
at the bottom. Their decease made no impression on the other flies
out promenading, who looked at them in the coolest manner (as if they
themselves were elephants, or something as far removed), until they met
the same fate. Curious to consider how heedless flies are!—perhaps they
thought as much at Court that sunny summer day.
A figure entering at the door threw a shadow on Madame Defarge
which she felt to be a new one. She laid down her knitting, and began
to pin her rose in her head-dress, before she looked at the figure.
It was curious. The moment Madame Defarge took up the rose, the
customers ceased talking, and began gradually to drop out of the wineshop.
“Good day, madame,” said the new-comer.
“Good day, monsieur.”
She said it aloud, but added to herself, as she resumed her knitting:
“Hah! Good day, age about forty, height about five feet nine, black hair,
generally rather handsome visage, complexion dark, eyes dark, thin,
long and sallow face, aquiline nose but not straight, having a peculiar
inclination towards the left cheek which imparts a sinister expression!
Good day, one and all!”
“Have the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a
mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.”
Madame complied with a polite air.
“Marvellous cognac this, madame!”
It was the first time it had ever been so complemented, and Madame
Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor
watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of
observing the place in general.
“You knit with great skill, madame.”
“I am accustomed to it.”
“A pretty pattern too!”
“You think so?” said madame, looking at him with a smile.
“Decidedly. May one ask what it is for?”
157
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Pastime,” said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her
fingers moved nimbly.
“Not for use?”
“That depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do—Well,” said
madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of
coquetry, “I’ll use it!”
It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two
men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when,
catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking
about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of
those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left.
They had all dropped off. The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been
able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken,
purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable.
“John,” thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. “Stay long enough, and I shall
knit ‘Barsad’ before you go.”
“You have a husband, madame?”
“I have.”
“Children?”
“No children.”
“Business seems bad?”
“Business is very bad; the people are so poor.”
“Ah, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too—as you
say.”
“As you say,” madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting
an extra something into his name that boded him no good.
“Pardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think
so. Of course.”
“I think?” returned madame, in a high voice. “I and my husband
have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All
we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject we think of, and it
gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. I think for others? No, no.”
The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make,
did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but,
stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame
Defarge’s little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac.
158
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“A bad business this, madame, of Gaspard’s execution. Ah! the
poor Gaspard!” With a sigh of great compassion.
“My faith!” returned madame, coolly and lightly, “if people use
knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand
what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.”
“I believe,” said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility
in every muscle of his wicked face: “I believe there is much compassion
and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between
ourselves.”
“Is there?” asked madame, vacantly.
“Is there not?”
“—Here is my husband!” said Madame Defarge.
As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted
him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, “Good
day, Jacques!” Defarge stopped short, and stared at him.
“Good day, Jacques!” the spy repeated; with not quite so much
confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare.
“You deceive yourself, monsieur,” returned the keeper of the wineshop. “You mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest
Defarge.”
“It is all the same,” said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: “good
day!”
“Good day!” answered Defarge, drily.
“I was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting
when you entered, that they tell me there is—and no wonder!—much
sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor
Gaspard.”
“No one has told me so,” said Defarge, shaking his head. “I know
nothing of it.”
Having said it, he passed behind the little counter, and stood with
his hand on the back of his wife’s chair, looking over that barrier at
the person to whom they were both opposed, and whom either of them
would have shot with the greatest satisfaction.
The spy, well used to his business, did not change his unconscious
attitude, but drained his little glass of cognac, took a sip of fresh water,
and asked for another glass of cognac. Madame Defarge poured it out
for him, took to her knitting again, and hummed a little song over it.
“You seem to know this quarter well; that is to say, better than I
159
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
do?” observed Defarge.
“Not at all, but I hope to know it better. I am so profoundly interested in its miserable inhabitants.”
“Hah!” muttered Defarge.
“The pleasure of conversing with you, Monsieur Defarge, recalls
to me,” pursued the spy, “that I have the honour of cherishing some
interesting associations with your name.”
“Indeed!” said Defarge, with much indifference.
“Yes, indeed. When Doctor Manette was released, you, his old domestic, had the charge of him, I know. He was delivered to you. You
see I am informed of the circumstances?”
“Such is the fact, certainly,” said Defarge. He had had it conveyed
to him, in an accidental touch of his wife’s elbow as she knitted and
warbled, that he would do best to answer, but always with brevity.
“It was to you,” said the spy, “that his daughter came; and it was
from your care that his daughter took him, accompanied by a neat
brown monsieur; how is he called?—in a little wig—Lorry—of the bank
of Tellson and Company—over to England.”
“Such is the fact,” repeated Defarge.
“Very interesting remembrances!” said the spy. “I have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England.”
“Yes?” said Defarge.
“You don’t hear much about them now?” said the spy.
“No,” said Defarge.
“In effect,” madame struck in, looking up from her work and her
little song, “we never hear about them. We received the news of their
safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then,
they have gradually taken their road in life—we, ours—and we have
held no correspondence.”
“Perfectly so, madame,” replied the spy. “She is going to be married.”
“Going?” echoed madame. “She was pretty enough to have been
married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.”
“Oh! You know I am English.”
“I perceive your tongue is,” returned madame; “and what the
tongue is, I suppose the man is.”
He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the
best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the
end, he added:
160
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that
she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom
Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the
present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis
there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. D’Aulnais is the name of his mother’s
family.”
Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled,
and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if
he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind.
Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be
worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad
paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to
say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward
to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again. For
some minutes after he had emerged into the outer presence of Saint
Antoine, the husband and wife remained exactly as he had left them,
lest he should come back.
“Can it be true,” said Defarge, in a low voice, looking down at his
wife as he stood smoking with his hand on the back of her chair: “what
he has said of Ma’amselle Manette?”
“As he has said it,” returned madame, lifting her eyebrows a little,
“it is probably false. But it may be true.”
“If it is—” Defarge began, and stopped.
“If it is?” repeated his wife.
“—And if it does come, while we live to see it triumph—I hope, for
her sake, Destiny will keep her husband out of France.”
“Her husband’s destiny,” said Madame Defarge, with her usual composure, “will take him where he is to go, and will lead him to the end
that is to end him. That is all I know.”
“But it is very strange—now, at least, is it not very strange”—said
Defarge, rather pleading with his wife to induce her to admit it, “that,
after all our sympathy for Monsieur her father, and herself, her husband’s name should be proscribed under your hand at this moment, by
the side of that infernal dog’s who has just left us?”
“Stranger things than that will happen when it does come,” an161
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
swered madame. “I have them both here, of a certainty; and they are
both here for their merits; that is enough.”
She roiled up her knitting when she had said those words, and
presently took the rose out of the handkerchief that was wound about
her head. Either Saint Antoine had an instinctive sense that the objectionable decoration was gone, or Saint Antoine was on the watch for
its disappearance; howbeit, the Saint took courage to lounge in, very
shortly afterwards, and the wine-shop recovered its habitual aspect.
In the evening, at which season of all others Saint Antoine turned
himself inside out, and sat on door-steps and window-ledges, and came
to the corners of vile streets and courts, for a breath of air, Madame
Defarge with her work in her hand was accustomed to pass from place
to place and from group to group: a Missionary—there were many like
her—such as the world will do well never to breed again. All the women
knitted. They knitted worthless things; but, the mechanical work was a
mechanical substitute for eating and drinking; the hands moved for the
jaws and the digestive apparatus: if the bony fingers had been still, the
stomachs would have been more famine-pinched.
But, as the fingers went, the eyes went, and the thoughts. And as
Madame Defarge moved on from group to group, all three went quicker
and fiercer among every little knot of women that she had spoken with,
and left behind.
Her husband smoked at his door, looking after her with admiration.
“A great woman,” said he, “a strong woman, a grand woman, a frightfully grand woman!”
Darkness closed around, and then came the ringing of church bells
and the distant beating of the military drums in the Palace Courtyard,
as the women sat knitting, knitting. Darkness encompassed them. Another darkness was closing in as surely, when the church bells, then ringing pleasantly in many an airy steeple over France, should be melted
into thundering cannon; when the military drums should be beating to
drown a wretched voice, that night all potent as the voice of Power and
Plenty, Freedom and Life. So much was closing in about the women
who sat knitting, knitting, that they their very selves were closing in
around a structure yet unbuilt, where they were to sit knitting, knitting,
counting dropping heads.

Chapter 17
One Night
Never did the sun go down with a brighter glory on the quiet corner in
Soho, than one memorable evening when the Doctor and his daughter
sat under the plane-tree together. Never did the moon rise with a milder
radiance over great London, than on that night when it found them still
seated under the tree, and shone upon their faces through its leaves.
Lucie was to be married to-morrow. She had reserved this last
evening for her father, and they sat alone under the plane-tree.
“You are happy, my dear father?”
“Quite, my child.”
They had said little, though they had been there a long time. When it
was yet light enough to work and read, she had neither engaged herself
in her usual work, nor had she read to him. She had employed herself in
both ways, at his side under the tree, many and many a time; but, this
time was not quite like any other, and nothing could make it so.
“And I am very happy to-night, dear father. I am deeply happy in
the love that Heaven has so blessed—my love for Charles, and Charles’s
love for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or
if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the
length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and selfreproachful now than I can tell you. Even as it is—”
Even as it was, she could not command her voice.
In the sad moonlight, she clasped him by the neck, and laid her face
upon his breast. In the moonlight which is always sad, as the light of
the sun itself is—as the light called human life is—at its coming and its
going.
“Dearest dear! Can you tell me, this last time, that you feel quite,
quite sure, no new affections of mine, and no new duties of mine, will
ever interpose between us? I know it well, but do you know it? In your
own heart, do you feel quite certain?”
Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could
scarcely have assumed, “Quite sure, my darling! More than that,” he
added, as he tenderly kissed her: “my future is far brighter, Lucie, seen
through your marriage, than it could have been—nay, than it ever was—
without it.”
“If I could hope that, my father!—”
163
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Believe it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how
plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be
wasted—”
She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and
repeated the word.
“—wasted, my child—should not be wasted, struck aside from the
natural order of things—for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely
comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?”
“If I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite
happy with you.”
He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been
unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied:
“My child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been
Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I
should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would
have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.”
It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him
refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long
afterwards.
“See!” said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the
moon. “I have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not
bear her light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to
me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my
head against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dun and
lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal
lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular
lines with which I could intersect them.” He added in his inward and
pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, “It was twenty either way,
I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.”
The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time,
deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in
the manner of his reference. He only seemed to contrast his present
cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over.
“I have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it
had been born alive, or the poor mother’s shock had killed it. Whether
164
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
it was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a
time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it was a son who would never know his father’s story;
who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father’s having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would
grow to be a woman.”
She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand.
“I have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of
me—rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have
cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to
a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from
the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was
a blank.”
“My father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter
who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.”
“You, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have
brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and
the moon on this last night.—What did I say just now?”
“She knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.”
“So! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way—have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain
for its foundations could—I have imagined her as coming to me in my
cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have
seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I
never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window
and the door. But, you understand that that was not the child I am
speaking of?”
“The figure was not; the—the—image; the fancy?”
“No. That was another thing. It stood before my disturbed sense
of sight, but it never moved. The phantom that my mind pursued, was
another and more real child. Of her outward appearance I know no
more than that she was like her mother. The other had that likeness
too—as you have—but was not the same. Can you follow me, Lucie?
Hardly, I think? I doubt you must have been a solitary prisoner to
understand these perplexed distinctions.”
His collected and calm manner could not prevent her blood from
running cold, as he thus tried to anatomise his old condition.
“In that more peaceful state, I have imagined her, in the moonlight,
165
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
coming to me and taking me out to show me that the home of her
married life was full of her loving remembrance of her lost father. My
picture was in her room, and I was in her prayers. Her life was active,
cheerful, useful; but my poor history pervaded it all.”
“I was that child, my father, I was not half so good, but in my love
that was I.”
“And she showed me her children,” said the Doctor of Beauvais,
“and they had heard of me, and had been taught to pity me. When they
passed a prison of the State, they kept far from its frowning walls, and
looked up at its bars, and spoke in whispers. She could never deliver
me; I imagined that she always brought me back after showing me such
things. But then, blessed with the relief of tears, I fell upon my knees,
and blessed her.”
“I am that child, I hope, my father. O my dear, my dear, will you
bless me as fervently to-morrow?”
“Lucie, I recall these old troubles in the reason that I have to-night
for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my
great happiness. My thoughts, when they were wildest, never rose near
the happiness that I have known with you, and that we have before us.”
He embraced her, solemnly commended her to Heaven, and humbly
thanked Heaven for having bestowed her on him. By-and-bye, they
went into the house.
There was no one bidden to the marriage but Mr. Lorry; there was
even to be no bridesmaid but the gaunt Miss Pross. The marriage was
to make no change in their place of residence; they had been able to
extend it, by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging
to the apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.
Doctor Manette was very cheerful at the little supper. They were
only three at table, and Miss Pross made the third. He regretted that
Charles was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the
loving little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affectionately.
So, the time came for him to bid Lucie good night, and they separated. But, in the stillness of the third hour of the morning, Lucie came
downstairs again, and stole into his room; not free from unshaped fears,
beforehand.
All things, however, were in their places; all was quiet; and he lay
asleep, his white hair picturesque on the untroubled pillow, and his
hands lying quiet on the coverlet. She put her needless candle in the
shadow at a distance, crept up to his bed, and put her lips to his; then,
166
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
leaned over him, and looked at him.
Into his handsome face, the bitter waters of captivity had worn; but,
he covered up their tracks with a determination so strong, that he held
the mastery of them even in his sleep. A more remarkable face in its
quiet, resolute, and guarded struggle with an unseen assailant, was not
to be beheld in all the wide dominions of sleep, that night.
She timidly laid her hand on his dear breast, and put up a prayer
that she might ever be as true to him as her love aspired to be, and as
his sorrows deserved. Then, she withdrew her hand, and kissed his lips
once more, and went away. So, the sunrise came, and the shadows of
the leaves of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips
had moved in praying for him.
Chapter 18
Nine Days
The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the Doctor’s room, where he was speaking with Charles
Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross—to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but
for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have
been the bridegroom.
“And so,” said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the
bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of
her quiet, pretty dress; “and so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I
brought you across the Channel, such a baby’ Lord bless me’ How little
I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was
conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!”
“You didn’t mean it,” remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, “and
therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!”
“Really? Well; but don’t cry,” said the gentle Mr. Lorry.
“I am not crying,” said Miss Pross; “you are.”
“I, my Pross?” (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with
her, on occasion.)
“You were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don’t wonder at it. Such
a present of plate as you have made ’em, is enough to bring tears into
167
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
anybody’s eyes. There’s not a fork or a spoon in the collection,” said
Miss Pross, “that I didn’t cry over, last night after the box came, till I
couldn’t see it.”
“I am highly gratified,” said Mr. Lorry, “though, upon my honour,
I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance
invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man
speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might
have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!”
“Not at all!” From Miss Pross.
“You think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?” asked the
gentleman of that name.
“Pooh!” rejoined Miss Pross; “you were a bachelor in your cradle.”
“Well!” observed Mr. Lorry, beamingly adjusting his little wig, “that
seems probable, too.”
“And you were cut out for a bachelor,” pursued Miss Pross, “before
you were put in your cradle.”
“Then, I think,” said Mr. Lorry, “that I was very unhandsomely
dealt with, and that I ought to have had a voice in the selection of my
pattern. Enough! Now, my dear Lucie,” drawing his arm soothingly
round her waist, “I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross
and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final
opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You
leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as
your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next
fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson’s
shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at
the fortnight’s end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband,
on your other fortnight’s trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent
him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear
Somebody’s step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an
old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his
own.”
For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the wellremembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden
hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy
which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.
The door of the Doctor’s room opened, and he came out with
Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale—which had not been the case
when they went in together—that no vestige of colour was to be seen in
168
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except
that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over
him, like a cold wind.
He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the
chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where
no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were
happily married.
Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the bride’s hand, which were newly released from the dark
obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry’s pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker’s white locks in the Paris garret, were
mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of
the door at parting.
It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, “Take her, Charles! She is yours!”
And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and
she was gone.
The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry,
and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great
change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there,
had struck him a poisoned blow.
He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have
been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But,
it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through
his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away
into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of
Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.
“I think,” he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration,
“I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him.
I must look in at Tellson’s; so I will go there at once and come back
presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there,
and all will be well.”
169
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson’s, than to look out
of Tellson’s. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant;
going thus into the Doctor’s rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of
knocking.
“Good God!” he said, with a start. “What’s that?”
Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear. “O me, O me! All is
lost!” cried she, wringing her hands. “What is to be told to Ladybird?
He doesn’t know me, and is making shoes!”
Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
Doctor’s room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was
bent down, and he was very busy.
“Doctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!”
The Doctor looked at him for a moment—half inquiringly, half as if
he were angry at being spoken to—and bent over his work again.
He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the
throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard—
impatiently—as if in some sense of having been interrupted.
Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was
a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by
him, and asked what it was.
“A young lady’s walking shoe,” he muttered, without looking up.
“It ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.”
“But, Doctor Manette. Look at me!”
He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without
pausing in his work.
“You know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your
proper occupation. Think, dear friend!”
Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an
instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion
would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked,
in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked.
In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity—as
though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.
Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important
170
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the
second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required
a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having
been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post.
These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in
the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept
another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he
thought the best, on the Doctor’s case.
In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being
thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so. He therefore
made arrangements to absent himself from Tellson’s for the first time in
his life, and took his post by the window in the same room.
He was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to
speak to him, since, on being pressed, he became worried. He abandoned that attempt on the first day, and resolved merely to keep himself
always before him, as a silent protest against the delusion into which he
had fallen, or was falling. He remained, therefore, in his seat near the
window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and
natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.
Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and
worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see—worked on, half
an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or
write. When he put his tools aside as useless, until morning, Mr. Lorry
rose and said to him:
“Will you go out?”
He looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner,
looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:
“Out?”
“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”
He made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. But,
Mr. Lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the
dusk, with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he
was in some misty way asking himself, “Why not?” The sagacity of the
171
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
man of business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold
it.
Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed
him at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a
long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down,
he fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to
his bench and to work.
On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that
he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to
have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those
times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was
done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or
often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry’s friendly heart
to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred
by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.
When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before:
“Dear Doctor, will you go out?”
As before, he repeated, “Out?”
“Yes; for a walk with me. Why not?”
This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no
answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In
the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and
had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry’s return,
be slipped away to his bench.
The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry’s hope darkened, and
his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every
day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six
days, seven days, eight days, nine days.
With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret
was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not
fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out
at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so
intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and
expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.

Chapter 19
An Opinion
Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post. On the
tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun
into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was
dark night.
He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he
had done so, whether he was not still asleep. For, going to the door
of the Doctor’s room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker’s
bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat
reading at the window. He was in his usual morning dress, and his face
(which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly
studious and attentive.
Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt
giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking
might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show
him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and
employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the
change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?
It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?
How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor
Manette’s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
Doctor’s bedroom door in the early morning?
Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If
he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour,
and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If
he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then
cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he
had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.
Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was
worked out with care. Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in
173
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg. The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.
So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping
those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the
only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter’s marriage had
taken place yesterday. An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out,
to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and
counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however,
he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the
aid he sought. And that aid was his own.
Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he
and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly:
“My dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to
say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may
be less so.”
Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work,
the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already
glanced at his hands more than once.
“Doctor Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on
the arm, “the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray
give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake—and above all, for
his daughter’s—his daughter’s, my dear Manette.”
“If I understand,” said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, “some mental
shock—?”
“Yes!”
“Be explicit,” said the Doctor. “Spare no detail.”
Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded.
“My dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of
great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the—the—as
you express it—the mind. The mind. It is the case of a shock under
which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no
other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the
sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself—as I once
heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock
from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of
body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowl174
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
edge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been,”
he paused and took a deep breath—“a slight relapse.”
The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, “Of how long duration?”
“Nine days and nights.”
“How did it show itself? I infer,” glancing at his hands again, “in
the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?”
“That is the fact.”
“Now, did you ever see him,” asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, “engaged in that pursuit originally?”
“Once.”
“And when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects—or in
all respects—as he was then?”
“I think in all respects.”
“You spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?”
“No. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from
her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.”
The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, “That was very kind.
That was very thoughtful!” Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and
neither of the two spoke for a little while.
“Now, my dear Manette,” said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most
considerate and most affectionate way, “I am a mere man of business,
and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not
possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of
intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom
I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this
relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of
it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does
it come about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can
have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve
mine, if I knew how.
But I don’t know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity,
knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might
be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little.
Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly,
and teach me how to be a little more useful.“
Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him.
175
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I think it probable,” said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, “that the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite
unforeseen by its subject.”
“Was it dreaded by him?” Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.
“Very much.” He said it with an involuntary shudder.
“You have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer’s mind, and how difficult—how almost impossible—it is, for him
to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him.”
“Would he,” asked Mr. Lorry, “be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one, when it is
on him?”
“I think so. But it is, as I have told you, next to impossible. I even
believe it—in some cases—to be quite impossible.”
“Now,” said Mr. Lorry, gently laying his hand on the Doctor’s arm
again, after a short silence on both sides, “to what would you refer this
attack?”
“I believe,” returned Doctor Manette, “that there had been a strong
and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that
was the first cause of the malady. Some intense associations of a most
distressing nature were vividly recalled, I think. It is probable that there
had long been a dread lurking in his mind, that those associations would
be recalled—say, under certain circumstances—say, on a particular occasion. He tried to prepare himself in vain; perhaps the effort to prepare
himself made him less able to bear it.”
“Would he remember what took place in the relapse?” asked Mr.
Lorry, with natural hesitation.
The Doctor looked desolately round the room, shook his head, and
answered, in a low voice, “Not at all.”
“Now, as to the future,” hinted Mr. Lorry.
“As to the future,” said the Doctor, recovering firmness, “I should
have great hope. As it pleased Heaven in its mercy to restore him so
soon, I should have great hope. He, yielding under the pressure of a
complicated something, long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and
contended against, and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed,
I should hope that the worst was over.”
“Well, well! That’s good comfort. I am thankful!” said Mr. Lorry.
“I am thankful!” repeated the Doctor, bending his head with reverence.
“There are two other points,” said Mr. Lorry, “on which I am anx176
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ious to be instructed. I may go on?”
“You cannot do your friend a better service.” The Doctor gave him
his hand.
“To the first, then. He is of a studious habit, and unusually energetic;
he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional
knowledge, to the conducting of experiments, to many things. Now,
does he do too much?”
“I think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in
singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part,
the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the
more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He
may have observed himself, and made the discovery.”
“You are sure that he is not under too great a strain?”
“I think I am quite sure of it.”
“My dear Manette, if he were overworked now—”
“My dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a
violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.”
“Excuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he was overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of
this disorder?”
“I do not think so. I do not think,” said Doctor Manette with the
firmness of self-conviction, “that anything but the one train of association would renew it. I think that, henceforth, nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it. After what has happened,
and after his recovery, I find it difficult to imagine any such violent
sounding of that string again. I trust, and I almost believe, that the
circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted.”
He spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing
would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. It was not for his friend to abate that confidence.
He professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was,
and approached his second and last point. He felt it to be the most
difficult of all; but, remembering his old Sunday morning conversation
with Miss Pross, and remembering what he had seen in the last nine
days, he knew that he must face it.
“The occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,” said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, “we
will call—Blacksmith’s work, Blacksmith’s work. We will say, to put a
177
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad
time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly
found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?”
The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot
nervously on the ground.
“He has always kept it by him,” said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious
look at his friend. “Now, would it not be better that he should let it
go?”
Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on
the ground.
“You do not find it easy to advise me?” said Mr. Lorry. “I quite
understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think—” And there he
shook his head, and stopped.
“You see,” said Doctor Manette, turning to him after an uneasy
pause, “it is very hard to explain, consistently, the innermost workings
of this poor man’s mind. He once yearned so frightfully for that occupation, and it was so welcome when it came; no doubt it relieved his pain
so much, by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity
of the brain, and by substituting, as he became more practised, the ingenuity of the hands, for the ingenuity of the mental torture; that he has
never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach.
Even now, when I believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever
been, and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence, the idea that
he might need that old employment, and not find it, gives him a sudden
sense of terror, like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a
lost child.”
He looked like his illustration, as he raised his eyes to Mr. Lorry’s
face.
“But may not—mind! I ask for information, as a plodding man of
business who only deals with such material objects as guineas, shillings,
and bank-notes—may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea? If the thing were gone, my dear Manette, might not
the fear go with it? In short, is it not a concession to the misgiving, to
keep the forge?”
There was another silence.
“You see, too,” said the Doctor, tremulously, “it is such an old companion.”
“I would not keep it,” said Mr. Lorry, shaking his head; for he
gained in firmness as he saw the Doctor disquieted. “I would recom178
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mend him to sacrifice it. I only want your authority. I am sure it does
no good. Come! Give me your authority, like a dear good man. For his
daughter’s sake, my dear Manette!”
Very strange to see what a struggle there was within him!
“In her name, then, let it be done; I sanction it. But, I would not
take it away while he was present. Let it be removed when he is not
there; let him miss his old companion after an absence.”
Mr. Lorry readily engaged for that, and the conference was ended.
They passed the day in the country, and the Doctor was quite restored.
On the three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth day he went away to join Lucie and her husband. The precaution
that had been taken to account for his silence, Mr. Lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to Lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions.
On the night of the day on which he left the house, Mr. Lorry went
into his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by
Miss Pross carrying a light. There, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and guilty manner, Mr. Lorry hacked the shoemaker’s bench to
pieces, while Miss Pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a
murder—for which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. The burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient
for the purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and
the tools, shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. So wicked do
destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds, that Mr. Lorry and
Miss Pross, while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the
removal of its traces, almost felt, and almost looked, like accomplices
in a horrible crime.
Chapter 20
A Plea
When the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared,
to offer his congratulations, was Sydney Carton. They had not been at
home many hours, when he presented himself. He was not improved
in habits, or in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged
air of fidelity about him, which was new to the observation of Charles
Darnay.
179
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He watched his opportunity of taking Darnay aside into a window,
and of speaking to him when no one overheard.
“Mr. Darnay,” said Carton, “I wish we might be friends.”
“We are already friends, I hope.”
“You are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, I don’t
mean any fashion of speech. Indeed, when I say I wish we might be
friends, I scarcely mean quite that, either.”
Charles Darnay—as was natural—asked him, in all good-humour
and good-fellowship, what he did mean?
“Upon my life,” said Carton, smiling, “I find that easier to comprehend in my own mind, than to convey to yours. However, let me
try. You remember a certain famous occasion when I was more drunk
than—than usual?”
“I remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking.”
“I remember it too. The curse of those occasions is heavy upon me,
for I always remember them. I hope it may be taken into account one
day, when all days are at an end for me! Don’t be alarmed; I am not
going to preach.”
“I am not at all alarmed. Earnestness in you, is anything but alarming to me.”
“Ah!” said Carton, with a careless wave of his hand, as if he waved
that away. “On the drunken occasion in question (one of a large number,
as you know), I was insufferable about liking you, and not liking you. I
wish you would forget it.”
“I forgot it long ago.”
“Fashion of speech again! But, Mr. Darnay, oblivion is not so easy
to me, as you represent it to be to you. I have by no means forgotten it,
and a light answer does not help me to forget it.”
“If it was a light answer,” returned Darnay, “I beg your forgiveness
for it. I had no other object than to turn a slight thing, which, to my
surprise, seems to trouble you too much, aside. I declare to you, on the
faith of a gentleman, that I have long dismissed it from my mind. Good
Heaven, what was there to dismiss! Have I had nothing more important
to remember, in the great service you rendered me that day?”
“As to the great service,” said Carton, “I am bound to avow to you,
when you speak of it in that way, that it was mere professional claptrap,
I don’t know that I cared what became of you, when I rendered it.—
Mind! I say when I rendered it; I am speaking of the past.”
180
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“You make light of the obligation,” returned Darnay, “but I will not
quarrel with your light answer.”
“Genuine truth, Mr. Darnay, trust me! I have gone aside from my
purpose; I was speaking about our being friends. Now, you know me;
you know I am incapable of all the higher and better flights of men. If
you doubt it, ask Stryver, and he’ll tell you so.”
“I prefer to form my own opinion, without the aid of his.”
“Well! At any rate you know me as a dissolute dog, who has never
done any good, and never will.”
“I don’t know that you ‘never will.’ ”
“But I do, and you must take my word for it. Well! If you could
endure to have such a worthless fellow, and a fellow of such indifferent
reputation, coming and going at odd times, I should ask that I might
be permitted to come and go as a privileged person here; that I might
be regarded as an useless (and I would add, if it were not for the resemblance I detected between you and me, an unornamental) piece of
furniture, tolerated for its old service, and taken no notice of. I doubt
if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail
myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know
that I had it.”
“Will you try?”
“That is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I
have indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your
name?”
“I think so, Carton, by this time.”
They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a
minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial
as ever.
When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss
Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention
of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who
saw him as he showed himself.
He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.
“We are thoughtful to-night!” said Darnay, drawing his arm about
181
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
her.
“Yes, dearest Charles,” with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; “we are rather thoughtful
to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.”
“What is it, my Lucie?”
“Will you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not
to ask it?”
“Will I promise? What will I not promise to my Love?”
What, indeed, with his hand putting aside the golden hair from the
cheek, and his other hand against the heart that beat for him!
“I think, Charles, poor Mr. Carton deserves more consideration and
respect than you expressed for him to-night.”
“Indeed, my own? Why so?”
“That is what you are not to ask me. But I think—I know—he
does.”
“If you know it, it is enough. What would you have me do, my
Life?”
“I would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and
very lenient on his faults when he is not by. I would ask you to believe
that he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. My dear, I have seen it bleeding.”
“It is a painful reflection to me,” said Charles Darnay, quite astounded, “that I should have done him any wrong. I never thought
this of him.”
“My husband, it is so. I fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. But, I am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things, even
magnanimous things.”
She looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.
“And, O my dearest Love!” she urged, clinging nearer to him, laying
her head upon his breast, and raising her eyes to his, “remember how
strong we are in our happiness, and how weak he is in his misery!”
The supplication touched him home. “I will always remember it,
dear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.”
He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and
folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark
streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen
the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes
182
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night—and the
words would not have parted from his lips for the first time—
“God bless her for her sweet compassion!”
Chapter 21
Echoing Footsteps
A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where
the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound
her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and
companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the
tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years.
At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young
wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes
would be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes,
something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart
too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts—hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new
delight—divided her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise
the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so
much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.
That time passed, and her little Lucie lay on her bosom. Then,
among the advancing echoes, there was the tread of her tiny feet and the
sound of her prattling words. Let greater echoes resound as they would,
the young mother at the cradle side could always hear those coming.
They came, and the shady house was sunny with a child’s laugh, and
the Divine friend of children, to whom in her trouble she had confided
hers, seemed to take her child in his arms, as He took the child of old,
and made it a sacred joy to her.
Ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all their
lives, and making it predominate nowhere, Lucie heard in the echoes of
years none but friendly and soothing sounds. Her husband’s step was
strong and prosperous among them; her father’s firm and equal. Lo,
Miss Pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an unruly
183
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the planetree in the garden!
Even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were
not harsh nor cruel. Even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo
on a pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a
radiant smile, “Dear papa and mamma, I am very sorry to leave you
both, and to leave my pretty sister; but I am called, and I must go!”
those were not tears all of agony that wetted his young mother’s cheek,
as the spirit departed from her embrace that had been entrusted to it.
Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father’s face. O Father,
blessed words!
Thus, the rustling of an Angel’s wings got blended with the other
echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath
of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb
were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a
hushed murmur—like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a
sandy shore—as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the
morning, or dressing a doll at her mother’s footstool, chattered in the
tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life.
The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton.
Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he
had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one
other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been
whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.
No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with
a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a
mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him—an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched
in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was
the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he
kept his place with her as she grew. The little boy had spoken of him,
almost at the last. “Poor Carton! Kiss him for me!”
Mr. Stryver shouldered his way through the law, like some great
engine forcing itself through turbid water, and dragged his useful friend
in his wake, like a boat towed astern. As the boat so favoured is usually
in a rough plight, and mostly under water, so, Sydney had a swamped
life of it. But, easy and strong custom, unhappily so much easier and
stronger in him than any stimulating sense of desert or disgrace, made
184
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
it the life he was to lead; and he no more thought of emerging from his
state of lion’s jackal, than any real jackal may be supposed to think of
rising to be a lion. Stryver was rich; had married a florid widow with
property and three boys, who had nothing particularly shining about
them but the straight hair of their dumpling heads.
These three young gentlemen, Mr. Stryver, exuding patronage of the
most offensive quality from every pore, had walked before him like
three sheep to the quiet corner in Soho, and had offered as pupils to
Lucie’s husband: delicately saying “Halloa! here are three lumps of
bread-and-cheese towards your matrimonial picnic, Darnay!” The polite rejection of the three lumps of bread-and-cheese had quite bloated
Mr. Stryver with indignation, which he afterwards turned to account
in the training of the young gentlemen, by directing them to beware of
the pride of Beggars, like that tutor-fellow. He was also in the habit of
declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs.
Darnay had once put in practice to “catch” him, and on the diamondcut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him “not to
be caught.” Some of his King’s Bench familiars, who were occasionally
parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by
saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself—which is
surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as
to justify any such offender’s being carried off to some suitably retired
spot, and there hanged out of the way.
These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive,
sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until
her little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes
of her child’s tread came, and those of her own dear father’s, always
active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband’s, need not
be told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by
herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant
than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about
her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he
found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single,
and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and
duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked
her “What is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to
all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried,
or to have too much to do?”
But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menac185
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ingly in the corner all through this space of time. And it was now, about
little Lucie’s sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as
of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising.
On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine,
Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson’s, and sat himself down by Lucie
and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they
were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked
at the lightning from the same place.
“I began to think,” said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back,
“that I should have to pass the night at Tellson’s. We have been so full
of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which
way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually
a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be
able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a
mania among some of them for sending it to England.”
“That has a bad look,” said Darnay—
“A bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don’t know
what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us
at Tellson’s are getting old, and we really can’t be troubled out of the
ordinary course without due occasion.”
“Still,” said Darnay, “you know how gloomy and threatening the
sky is.”
“I know that, to be sure,” assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade
himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, “but I
am determined to be peevish after my long day’s botheration. Where is
Manette?”
“Here he is,” said the Doctor, entering the dark room at the moment.
“I am quite glad you are at home; for these hurries and forebodings
by which I have been surrounded all day long, have made me nervous
without reason. You are not going out, I hope?”
“No; I am going to play backgammon with you, if you like,” said
the Doctor.
“I don’t think I do like, if I may speak my mind. I am not fit to be
pitted against you to-night. Is the teaboard still there, Lucie? I can’t
see.”
“Of course, it has been kept for you.”
“Thank ye, my dear. The precious child is safe in bed?”
“And sleeping soundly.”
“That’s right; all safe and well! I don’t know why anything should
186
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
be otherwise than safe and well here, thank God; but I have been so put
out all day, and I am not as young as I was! My tea, my dear! Thank
ye. Now, come and take your place in the circle, and let us sit quiet, and
hear the echoes about which you have your theory.”
“Not a theory; it was a fancy.”
“A fancy, then, my wise pet,” said Mr. Lorry, patting her hand.
“They are very numerous and very loud, though, are they not? Only
hear them!”
Headlong, mad, and dangerous footsteps to force their way into
anybody’s life, footsteps not easily made clean again if once stained red,
the footsteps raging in Saint Antoine afar off, as the little circle sat in
the dark London window.
Saint Antoine had been, that morning, a vast dusky mass of scarecrows heaving to and fro, with frequent gleams of light above the billowy heads, where steel blades and bayonets shone in the sun. A tremendous roar arose from the throat of Saint Antoine, and a forest of naked
arms struggled in the air like shrivelled branches of trees in a winter
wind: all the fingers convulsively clutching at every weapon or semblance of a weapon that was thrown up from the depths below, no
matter how far off.
Who gave them out, whence they last came, where they began,
through what agency they crookedly quivered and jerked, scores at a
time, over the heads of the crowd, like a kind of lightning, no eye in the
throng could have told; but, muskets were being distributed—so were
cartridges, powder, and ball, bars of iron and wood, knives, axes, pikes,
every weapon that distracted ingenuity could discover or devise. People
who could lay hold of nothing else, set themselves with bleeding hands
to force stones and bricks out of their places in walls. Every pulse and
heart in Saint Antoine was on high-fever strain and at high-fever heat.
Every living creature there held life as of no account, and was demented
with a passionate readiness to sacrifice it.
As a whirlpool of boiling waters has a centre point, so, all this raging
circled round Defarge’s wine-shop, and every human drop in the caldron
had a tendency to be sucked towards the vortex where Defarge himself,
already begrimed with gunpowder and sweat, issued orders, issued arms,
thrust this man back, dragged this man forward, disarmed one to arm
another, laboured and strove in the thickest of the uproar.
“Keep near to me, Jacques Three,” cried Defarge; “and do you,
Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as
187
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
many of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?”
“Eh, well! Here you see me!” said madame, composed as ever, but
not knitting to-day. Madame’s resolute right hand was occupied with
an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a
pistol and a cruel knife.
“Where do you go, my wife?”
“I go,” said madame, “with you at present. You shall see me at the
head of women, by-and-bye.”
“Come, then!” cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. “Patriots and
friends, we are ready! The Bastille!”
With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been
shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth
on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing,
drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the
attack began.
Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great
towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through
the smoke—in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against
a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier—Defarge of the
wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.
Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! “Work,
comrades all, work! Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One
Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand;
in the name of all the Angels or the Devils—which you prefer—work!”
Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown
hot.
“To me, women!” cried madame his wife. “What! We can kill as
well as the men when the place is taken!” And to her, with a shrill thirsty
cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and
revenge.
Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single
drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight
displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard
work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious
sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still
188
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of
Four fierce hours.
A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley—this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it—suddenly the
sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wineshop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls,
in among the eight great towers surrendered!
So resistless was the force of the ocean bearing him on, that even
to draw his breath or turn his head was as impracticable as if he had
been struggling in the surf at the South Sea, until he was landed in the
outer courtyard of the Bastille. There, against an angle of a wall, he
made a struggle to look about him. Jacques Three was nearly at his
side; Madame Defarge, still heading some of her women, was visible
in the inner distance, and her knife was in her hand. Everywhere was
tumult, exultation, deafening and maniacal bewilderment, astounding
noise, yet furious dumb-show.
“The Prisoners!”
“The Records!”
“The secret cells!”
“The instruments of torture!”
“The Prisoners!”
Of all these cries, and ten thousand incoherences, “The Prisoners!”
was the cry most taken up by the sea that rushed in, as if there were
an eternity of people, as well as of time and space. When the foremost
billows rolled past, bearing the prison officers with them, and threatening them all with instant death if any secret nook remained undisclosed,
Defarge laid his strong hand on the breast of one of these men—a man
with a grey head, who had a lighted torch in his hand—separated him
from the rest, and got him between himself and the wall.
“Show me the North Tower!” said Defarge. “Quick!”
“I will faithfully,” replied the man, “if you will come with me. But
there is no one there.”
“What is the meaning of One Hundred and Five, North Tower?”
asked Defarge. “Quick!”
“The meaning, monsieur?”
“Does it mean a captive, or a place of captivity? Or do you mean
that I shall strike you dead?”
“Kill him!” croaked Jacques Three, who had come close up.
“Monsieur, it is a cell.”
189
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Show it me!”
“Pass this way, then.”
Jacques Three, with his usual craving on him, and evidently disappointed by the dialogue taking a turn that did not seem to promise
bloodshed, held by Defarge’s arm as he held by the turnkey’s. Their
three heads had been close together during this brief discourse, and it
had been as much as they could do to hear one another, even then: so
tremendous was the noise of the living ocean, in its irruption into the
Fortress, and its inundation of the courts and passages and staircases.
All around outside, too, it beat the walls with a deep, hoarse roar, from
which, occasionally, some partial shouts of tumult broke and leaped
into the air like spray.
Through gloomy vaults where the light of day had never shone, past
hideous doors of dark dens and cages, down cavernous flights of steps,
and again up steep rugged ascents of stone and brick, more like dry waterfalls than staircases, Defarge, the turnkey, and Jacques Three, linked
hand and arm, went with all the speed they could make. Here and there,
especially at first, the inundation started on them and swept by; but
when they had done descending, and were winding and climbing up a
tower, they were alone. Hemmed in here by the massive thickness of
walls and arches, the storm within the fortress and without was only
audible to them in a dull, subdued way, as if the noise out of which they
had come had almost destroyed their sense of hearing.
The turnkey stopped at a low door, put a key in a clashing lock,
swung the door slowly open, and said, as they all bent their heads and
passed in:
“One hundred and five, North Tower!”
There was a small, heavily-grated, unglazed window high in the wall,
with a stone screen before it, so that the sky could be only seen by stooping low and looking up. There was a small chimney, heavily barred
across, a few feet within. There was a heap of old feathery wood-ashes
on the hearth. There was a stool, and table, and a straw bed. There
were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them.
“Pass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,” said
Defarge to the turnkey.
The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his
eyes.
“Stop!—Look here, Jacques!”
“A. M.!” croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily.
190
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Alexandre Manette,” said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. “And
here he wrote ‘a poor physician.’ And it was he, without doubt, who
scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!”
He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten
stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows.
“Hold the light higher!” he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. “Look
among those fragments with care, Jacques. And see! Here is my knife,”
throwing it to him; “rip open that bed, and search the straw. Hold the
light higher, you!”
With a menacing look at the turnkey he crawled upon the hearth,
and, peering up the chimney, struck and prised at its sides with the
crowbar, and worked at the iron grating across it. In a few minutes,
some mortar and dust came dropping down, which he averted his face
to avoid; and in it, and in the old wood-ashes, and in a crevice in the
chimney into which his weapon had slipped or wrought itself, he groped
with a cautious touch.
“Nothing in the wood, and nothing in the straw, Jacques?”
“Nothing.”
“Let us collect them together, in the middle of the cell. So! Light
them, you!”
The turnkey fired the little pile, which blazed high and hot. Stooping again to come out at the low-arched door, they left it burning, and
retraced their way to the courtyard; seeming to recover their sense of
hearing as they came down, until they were in the raging flood once
more.
They found it surging and tossing, in quest of Defarge himself. Saint
Antoine was clamorous to have its wine-shop keeper foremost in the
guard upon the governor who had defended the Bastille and shot the
people. Otherwise, the governor would not be marched to the Hotel de
Ville for judgment. Otherwise, the governor would escape, and the people’s blood (suddenly of some value, after many years of worthlessness)
be unavenged.
In the howling universe of passion and contention that seemed to
encompass this grim old officer conspicuous in his grey coat and red decoration, there was but one quite steady figure, and that was a woman’s.
“See, there is my husband!” she cried, pointing him out. “See Defarge!”
191
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
She stood immovable close to the grim old officer, and remained immovable close to him; remained immovable close to him through the streets,
as Defarge and the rest bore him along; remained immovable close to
him when he was got near his destination, and began to be struck at
from behind; remained immovable close to him when the long-gathering
rain of stabs and blows fell heavy; was so close to him when he dropped
dead under it, that, suddenly animated, she put her foot upon his neck,
and with her cruel knife—long ready—hewed off his head.
The hour was come, when Saint Antoine was to execute his horrible
idea of hoisting up men for lamps to show what he could be and do.
Saint Antoine’s blood was up, and the blood of tyranny and domination by the iron hand was down—down on the steps of the Hotel de
Ville where the governor’s body lay—down on the sole of the shoe of
Madame Defarge where she had trodden on the body to steady it for
mutilation. “Lower the lamp yonder!” cried Saint Antoine, after glaring round for a new means of death; “here is one of his soldiers to be
left on guard!” The swinging sentinel was posted, and the sea rushed
on.
The sea of black and threatening waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and
whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently
swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces hardened in the furnaces
of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.
But, in the ocean of faces where every fierce and furious expression was in vivid life, there were two groups of faces—each seven in
number—so fixedly contrasting with the rest, that never did sea roll
which bore more memorable wrecks with it. Seven faces of prisoners,
suddenly released by the storm that had burst their tomb, were carried
high overhead: all scared, all lost, all wondering and amazed, as if the
Last Day were come, and those who rejoiced around them were lost
spirits. Other seven faces there were, carried higher, seven dead faces,
whose drooping eyelids and half-seen eyes awaited the Last Day. Impassive faces, yet with a suspended—not an abolished—expression on
them; faces, rather, in a fearful pause, as having yet to raise the dropped
lids of the eyes, and bear witness with the bloodless lips, “Thou didst
it!”
Seven prisoners released, seven gory heads on pikes, the keys of the
accursed fortress of the eight strong towers, some discovered letters and
other memorials of prisoners of old time, long dead of broken hearts,—
192
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
such, and such—like, the loudly echoing footsteps of Saint Antoine escort through the Paris streets in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred
and eighty-nine. Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and
keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and
dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge’s wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained
red.
Chapter 22
The Sea Still Rises
Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which
to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he
could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when
Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of
trusting themselves to the saint’s mercies. The lamps across his streets
had a portentously elastic swing with them.
Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light
and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there
were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with
a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest
nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance
in it: “I know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to
support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me,
the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?” Every lean bare arm, that had
been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that
it could strike. The fingers of the knitting women were vicious, with the
experience that they could tear. There was a change in the appearance of
Saint Antoine; the image had been hammering into this for hundreds of
years, and the last finishing blows had told mightily on the expression.
Madame Defarge sat observing it, with such suppressed approval as
was to be desired in the leader of the Saint Antoine women. One of
her sisterhood knitted beside her. The short, rather plump wife of a
starved grocer, and the mother of two children withal, this lieutenant
had already earned the complimentary name of The Vengeance.
193
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Hark!” said The Vengeance. “Listen, then! Who comes?”
As if a train of powder laid from the outermost bound of Saint Antoine Quarter to the wine-shop door, had been suddenly fired, a fastspreading murmur came rushing along.
“It is Defarge,” said madame. “Silence, patriots!”
Defarge came in breathless, pulled off a red cap he wore, and looked
around him! “Listen, everywhere!” said madame again. “Listen to
him!” Defarge stood, panting, against a background of eager eyes and
open mouths, formed outside the door; all those within the wine-shop
had sprung to their feet.
“Say then, my husband. What is it?”
“News from the other world!”
“How, then?” cried madame, contemptuously. “The other world?”
“Does everybody here recall old Foulon, who told the famished people that they might eat grass, and who died, and went to Hell?”
“Everybody!” from all throats.
“The news is of him. He is among us!”
“Among us!” from the universal throat again. “And dead?”
“Not dead! He feared us so much—and with reason—that he caused
himself to be represented as dead, and had a grand mock-funeral. But
they have found him alive, hiding in the country, and have brought him
in. I have seen him but now, on his way to the Hotel de Ville, a prisoner.
I have said that he had reason to fear us. Say all! Had he reason?”
Wretched old sinner of more than threescore years and ten, if he had
never known it yet, he would have known it in his heart of hearts if he
could have heard the answering cry.
A moment of profound silence followed. Defarge and his wife
looked steadfastly at one another. The Vengeance stooped, and the jar
of a drum was heard as she moved it at her feet behind the counter.
“Patriots!” said Defarge, in a determined voice, “are we ready?”
Instantly Madame Defarge’s knife was in her girdle; the drum was
beating in the streets, as if it and a drummer had flown together by
magic; and The Vengeance, uttering terrific shrieks, and flinging her
arms about her head like all the forty Furies at once, was tearing from
house to house, rousing the women.
The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they
looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded,
194
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the
bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and
actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother!
Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into
the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat
grass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when
I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck
grass, when these breasts where dry with want! O mother of God, this
Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on
Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of
Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give
us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him
into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and
tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon,
and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled
under foot.
Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon
was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine
knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women
flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after
them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there
was not a human creature in Saint Antoine’s bosom but a few old crones
and the wailing children.
No. They were all by that time choking the Hall of Examination
where this old man, ugly and wicked, was, and overflowing into the
adjacent open space and streets. The Defarges, husband and wife, The
Vengeance, and Jacques Three, were in the first press, and at no great
distance from him in the Hall.
“See!” cried madame, pointing with her knife. “See the old villain
bound with ropes. That was well done to tie a bunch of grass upon his
back. Ha, ha! That was well done. Let him eat it now!” Madame put
her knife under her arm, and clapped her hands as at a play.
The people immediately behind Madame Defarge, explaining the
cause of her satisfaction to those behind them, and those again explaining to others, and those to others, the neighbouring streets resounded
195
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
with the clapping of hands. Similarly, during two or three hours of
drawl, and the winnowing of many bushels of words, Madame Defarge’s frequent expressions of impatience were taken up, with marvellous quickness, at a distance: the more readily, because certain men who
had by some wonderful exercise of agility climbed up the external architecture to look in from the windows, knew Madame Defarge well, and
acted as a telegraph between her and the crowd outside the building.
At length the sun rose so high that it struck a kindly ray as of hope
or protection, directly down upon the old prisoner’s head. The favour
was too much to bear; in an instant the barrier of dust and chaff that
had stood surprisingly long, went to the winds, and Saint Antoine had
got him!
It was known directly, to the furthest confines of the crowd. Defarge had but sprung over a railing and a table, and folded the miserable wretch in a deadly embrace—Madame Defarge had but followed
and turned her hand in one of the ropes with which he was tied—The
Vengeance and Jacques Three were not yet up with them, and the men
at the windows had not yet swooped into the Hall, like birds of prey
from their high perches—when the cry seemed to go up, all over the city,
“Bring him out! Bring him to the lamp!”
Down, and up, and head foremost on the steps of the building; now,
on his knees; now, on his feet; now, on his back; dragged, and struck
at, and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into
his face by hundreds of hands; torn, bruised, panting, bleeding, yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy; now full of vehement agony
of action, with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see; now, a log of dead wood drawn through
a forest of legs; he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one
of the fatal lamps swung, and there Madame Defarge let him go—as a
cat might have done to a mouse—and silently and composedly looked
at him while they made ready, and while he besought her: the women
passionately screeching at him all the time, and the men sternly calling
out to have him killed with grass in his mouth. Once, he went aloft,
and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; twice, he went aloft,
and the rope broke, and they caught him shrieking; then, the rope was
merciful, and held him, and his head was soon upon a pike, with grass
enough in the mouth for all Saint Antoine to dance at the sight of.
Nor was this the end of the day’s bad work, for Saint Antoine so
shouted and danced his angry blood up, that it boiled again, on hearing
196
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
when the day closed in that the son-in-law of the despatched, another of
the people’s enemies and insulters, was coming into Paris under a guard
five hundred strong, in cavalry alone. Saint Antoine wrote his crimes
on flaring sheets of paper, seized him—would have torn him out of the
breast of an army to bear Foulon company—set his head and heart on
pikes, and carried the three spoils of the day, in Wolf-procession through
the streets.
Not before dark night did the men and women come back to the
children, wailing and breadless. Then, the miserable bakers’ shops were
beset by long files of them, patiently waiting to buy bad bread; and while
they waited with stomachs faint and empty, they beguiled the time by
embracing one another on the triumphs of the day, and achieving them
again in gossip. Gradually, these strings of ragged people shortened and
frayed away; and then poor lights began to shine in high windows, and
slender fires were made in the streets, at which neighbours cooked in
common, afterwards supping at their doors.
Scanty and insufficient suppers those, and innocent of meat, as of
most other sauce to wretched bread. Yet, human fellowship infused
some nourishment into the flinty viands, and struck some sparks of
cheerfulness out of them. Fathers and mothers who had had their full
share in the worst of the day, played gently with their meagre children;
and lovers, with such a world around them and before them, loved and
hoped.
It was almost morning, when Defarge’s wine-shop parted with its
last knot of customers, and Monsieur Defarge said to madame his wife,
in husky tones, while fastening the door:
“At last it is come, my dear!”
“Eh well!” returned madame. “Almost.”
Saint Antoine slept, the Defarges slept: even The Vengeance slept
with her starved grocer, and the drum was at rest. The drum’s was the
only voice in Saint Antoine that blood and hurry had not changed. The
Vengeance, as custodian of the drum, could have wakened him up and
had the same speech out of him as before the Bastille fell, or old Foulon
was seized; not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in Saint
Antoine’s bosom.
197
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 23
Fire Rises
There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the
mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the
highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his
poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together. The prison on
the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it,
but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of
them knew what his men would do—beyond this: that it would probably not be what he was ordered.
Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.
Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people. Everything was bowed down,
dejected, oppressed, and broken. Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them—all worn
out.
Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of
luxurious and shining fife, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things
to this. Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur,
should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out! There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely! Thus it was,
however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the
flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that
its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to
bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and
unaccountable.
But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village
like it. For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and
wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase—now, found in hunting the people; now, found in
hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying
spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness. No. The change consisted
in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and
beautifying features of Monseigneur.

A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the
dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust
he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking
how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he
had it—in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and
viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on
foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a
frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern
without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian
aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a
mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of
many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds,
sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through
woods.
Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather,
as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he
could get from a shower of hail.
The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the
mill, and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just
intelligible:
“How goes it, Jacques?”
“All well, Jacques.”
“Touch then!”
They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones.
“No dinner?”
“Nothing but supper now,” said the mender of roads, with a hungry
face.
“It is the fashion,” growled the man. “I meet no dinner anywhere.”
He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel,
pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him
and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that
blazed and went out in a puff of smoke.
“Touch then.” It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this
time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands.
“To-night?” said the mender of roads.
“To-night,” said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth.
“Where?”
“Here.”
199
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently
at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy
charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village.
“Show me!” said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill.
“See!” returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. “You go
down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain—”
“To the Devil with all that!” interrupted the other, rolling his eye
over the landscape. “I go through no streets and past no fountains.
Well?”
“Well! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the
village.”
“Good. When do you cease to work?”
“At sunset.”
“Will you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights
without resting. Let me finish my pipe, and I shall sleep like a child.
Will you wake me?”
“Surely.”
The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off
his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones.
He was fast asleep directly.
As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds,
rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who
wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the
figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards
it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to
very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard,
the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff
and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living,
and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired
the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his
feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes,
stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many
long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was
into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get
a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for
he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his
lips. Fortified towns with their stockades, guard-houses, gates, trenches,
and drawbridges, seemed to the mender of roads, to be so much air as
200
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
against this figure. And when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon
and looked around, he saw in his small fancy similar figures, stopped
by no obstacle, tending to centres all over France.
The man slept on, indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of
brightness, to sunshine on his face and shadow, to the paltering lumps
of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed
them, until the sun was low in the west, and the sky was glowing. Then,
the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready
to go down into the village, roused him.
“Good!” said the sleeper, rising on his elbow. “Two leagues beyond
the summit of the hill?”
“About.”
“About. Good!”
The mender of roads went home, with the dust going on before him
according to the set of the wind, and was soon at the fountain, squeezing
himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink, and appearing
even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village. When the
village had taken its poor supper, it did not creep to bed, as it usually did,
but came out of doors again, and remained there. A curious contagion
of whispering was upon it, and also, when it gathered together at the
fountain in the dark, another curious contagion of looking expectantly
at the sky in one direction only. Monsieur Gabelle, chief functionary of
the place, became uneasy; went out on his house-top alone, and looked
in that direction too; glanced down from behind his chimneys at the
darkening faces by the fountain below, and sent word to the sacristan
who kept the keys of the church, that there might be need to ring the
tocsin by-and-bye.
The night deepened. The trees environing the old chateau, keeping
its solitary state apart, moved in a rising wind, as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom. Up the two
terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly, and beat at the great door,
like a swift messenger rousing those within; uneasy rushes of wind went
through the hall, among the old spears and knives, and passed lamenting up the stairs, and shook the curtains of the bed where the last Marquis had slept. East, West, North, and South, through the woods, four
heavy-treading, unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the
branches, striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard. Four
lights broke out there, and moved away in different directions, and all
was black again.
201
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
But, not for long. Presently, the chateau began to make itself
strangely visible by some light of its own, as though it were growing luminous. Then, a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the
front, picking out transparent places, and showing where balustrades,
arches, and windows were. Then it soared higher, and grew broader
and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst
forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire.
A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who
were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away.
There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was
drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam
stood at Monsieur Gabelle’s door. “Help, Gabelle! Help, every one!”
The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there
was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar
of fire in the sky. “It must be forty feet high,” said they, grimly; and
never moved.
The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away
through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on
the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. “Help, gentlemen—officers!
The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by
timely aid! Help, help!” The officers looked towards the soldiers who
looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting
of lips, “It must burn.”
As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the
village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred
and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea
of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles
in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything,
occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of
Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that
functionary’s part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority,
had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that
post-horses would roast.
The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring
and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from
the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the
rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were
202
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with
the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the
smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the
stake and contending with the fire.
The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire,
scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead
and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry;
the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat,
and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame. Great rents and
splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds
wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged
away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads,
guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.
The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing
the lawful ringer, rang for joy.
Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and
bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with
the collection of rent and taxes—though it was but a small instalment
of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days—
became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house,
summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon,
Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel
with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time
resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet,
and crush a man or two below.
Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the
distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an
ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate,
which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.
A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of
the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur
Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the
rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed,
and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that
while.
203
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were
other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the
rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had
been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople
less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the
functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung
up in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West,
North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned.
The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it,
no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate
successfully.
Chapter 24
Drawn to the Loadstone Rock
In such risings of fire and risings of sea—the firm earth shaken by the
rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the
flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the
shore—three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of
little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue
of the life of her home.
Many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes
in the corner, with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging
feet. For, the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a
people, tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in
danger, changed into wild beasts, by terrible enchantment long persisted
in.
Monseigneur, as a class, had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated: of his being so little wanted in
France, as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from
it, and this life together. Like the fabled rustic who raised the Devil with
infinite pains, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask
the Enemy no question, but immediately fled; so, Monseigneur, after
boldly reading the Lord’s Prayer backwards for a great number of years,
and performing many other potent spells for compelling the Evil One,
no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels.
204
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The shining Bull’s Eye of the Court was gone, or it would have been
the mark for a hurricane of national bullets. It had never been a good
eye to see with—had long had the mote in it of Lucifer’s pride, Sardana—
palus’s luxury, and a mole’s blindness—but it had dropped out and was
gone. The Court, from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten
ring of intrigue, corruption, and dissimulation, was all gone together.
Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and “suspended,”
when the last tidings came over.
The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two
was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide.
As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson’s Bank. Spirits are supposed to haunt
the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without
a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it
was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied
upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson’s was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high
estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and
anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances
to Tellson’s, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren.
To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported
himself and his tidings at Tellson’s, almost as a matter of course. For
such variety of reasons, Tellson’s was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the
public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous,
that Tellson’s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and
posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to
read.
On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and
Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice.
The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was
now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within
half an hour or so of the time of closing.
“But, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,” said
Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, “I must still suggest to you—”
“I understand. That I am too old?” said Mr. Lorry.
“Unsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a
disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.”
“My dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, “you
205
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is
safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of
hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better
worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not
a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from
our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business,
of old, and is in Tellson’s confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the
long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit
myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson’s, after all these
years, who ought to be?”
“I wish I were going myself,” said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.
“Indeed! You are a pretty fellow to object and advise!” exclaimed
Mr. Lorry. “You wish you were going yourself? And you a Frenchman
born? You are a wise counsellor.”
“My dear Mr. Lorry, it is because I am a Frenchman born, that
the thought (which I did not mean to utter here, however) has passed
through my mind often. One cannot help thinking, having had some
sympathy for the miserable people, and having abandoned something
to them,” he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner, “that one
might be listened to, and might have the power to persuade to some
restraint. Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to
Lucie—”
“When you were talking to Lucie,” Mr. Lorry repeated. “Yes. I
wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing
you were going to France at this time of day!”
“However, I am not going,” said Charles Darnay, with a smile. “It
is more to the purpose that you say you are.”
“And I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,” Mr.
Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, “you can
have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are
involved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences
would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized
or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can
say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying
of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm’s way, is within the
power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if
206
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
any one. And shall I hang back, when Tellson’s knows this and says
this—Tellson’s, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years—because I
am a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen
old codgers here!”
“How I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.”
“Tut! Nonsense, sir!—And, my dear Charles,” said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, “you are to remember, that getting things out of
Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here
(I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to
you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had
his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like
Old England; but now, everything is stopped.”
“And do you really go to-night?”
“I really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit
of delay.”
“And do you take no one with you?”
“All sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry. Jerry has been my
bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him.
Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or
of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his
master.”
“I must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.”
“I must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this
little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson’s proposal to retire
and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.”
This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry’s usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would
do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much
the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was
much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies
that had not been sown—as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted
to be done, that had led to it—as if observers of the wretched millions
in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have
made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before,
207
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring,
combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out
Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some
remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. And it was such
vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in
his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.
Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King’s Bench Bar, far on his
way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay
heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided
between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself
out.
The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened
letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person
to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to
Darnay that he saw the direction—the more quickly because it was his
own right name. The address, turned into English, ran:
“Very pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde,
of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers,
London, England.”
On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name
should be—unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation—kept inviolate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife
had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none.
“No,” said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; “I have referred it, I
think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.”
The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank,
there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry’s desk.
He held the letter out inquiringly; and Monseigneur looked at it, in the
person of this plotting and indignant refugee; and Monseigneur looked
at it in the person of that plotting and indignant refugee; and This, That,
208
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and The Other, all had something disparaging to say, in French or in
English, concerning the Marquis who was not to be found.
“Nephew, I believe—but in any case degenerate successor—of the
polished Marquis who was murdered,” said one. “Happy to say, I never
knew him.”
“A craven who abandoned his post,” said another—this Monseigneur had been got out of Paris, legs uppermost and half suffocated,
in a load of hay—“some years ago.”
“Infected with the new doctrines,” said a third, eyeing the direction
through his glass in passing; “set himself in opposition to the last Marquis, abandoned the estates when he inherited them, and left them to the
ruffian herd. They will recompense him now, I hope, as he deserves.”
“Hey?” cried the blatant Stryver. “Did he though? Is that the sort
of fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D—n the fellow!”
Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver
on the shoulder, and said:
“I know the fellow.”
“Do you, by Jupiter?” said Stryver. “I am sorry for it.”
“Why?”
“Why, Mr. Darnay? D’ye hear what he did? Don’t ask, why, in these
times.”
“But I do ask why?”
“Then I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry
to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow,
who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry
that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the
earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry
that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I’ll answer you.
I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel.
That’s why.”
Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself,
and said: “You may not understand the gentleman.”
“I understand how to put you in a corner, Mr. Darnay,” said Bully
Stryver, “and I’ll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I don’t understand
him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell
him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to
this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no,
gentlemen,” said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, “I
know something of human nature, and I tell you that you’ll never find
209
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious
proteges. No, gentlemen; he’ll always show ’em a clean pair of heels
very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.”
With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his
hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in
the general departure from the Bank.
“Will you take charge of the letter?” said Mr. Lorry. “You know
where to deliver it?”
“I do.”
“Will you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been
addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and
that it has been here some time?”
“I will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?”
“From here, at eight.”
“I will come back, to see you off.”
Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men,
Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened
the letter, and read it. These were its contents:
“Prison of the Abbaye, Paris.
“June 21, 1792.
“Monsieur heretofore the Marquis.
“After having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought
a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal.
Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed—razed to the ground.
“The crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the
Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and
shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them
for an emigrant. It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them,
and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent
that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the
imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had
had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for
an emigrant, and where is that emigrant?
“Ah! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that
emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will
he not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the
210
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Marquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps
reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris!
“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of
your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
to succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh
Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me!
“From this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer
and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis,
the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service.
“Your afflicted,
“Gabelle.”
The latent uneasiness in Darnay’s mind was roused to vigourous life
by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only
crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully
in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what
to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.
He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his
resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold,
he had acted imperfectly. He knew very well, that in his love for Lucie,
his renunciation of his social place, though by no means new to his own
mind, had been hurried and incomplete. He knew that he ought to have
systematically worked it out and supervised it, and that he had meant
to do it, and that it had never been done.
The happiness of his own chosen English home, the necessity of being always actively employed, the swift changes and troubles of the time
which had followed on one another so fast, that the events of this week
annihilated the immature plans of last week, and the events of the week
following made all new again; he knew very well, that to the force of
these circumstances he had yielded:—not without disquiet, but still without continuous and accumulating resistance. That he had watched the
times for a time of action, and that they had shifted and struggled until
the time had gone by, and the nobility were trooping from France by
every highway and byway, and their property was in course of confiscation and destruction, and their very names were blotting out, was as
well known to himself as it could be to any new authority in France that
might impeach him for it.
But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was
211
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had
relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no
favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread.
Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on
written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there
was to give—such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the
winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the
summer—and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.
This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to
make, that he would go to Paris.
Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had
driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind
drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he
who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there,
trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy
and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching
him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the
brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison
(injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur,
which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were
coarse and galling, for old reasons. Upon those, had followed Gabelle’s
letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his
justice, honour, and good name.
His resolution was made. He must go to Paris.
Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on,
until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The
intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he
had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be
gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it.
Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine
mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution
that was running so fearfully wild.
As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that
neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie
212
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant
to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come
to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of
suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation
was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving
old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself.
But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.
He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to Tellson’s and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived
in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now.
A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry
was booted and equipped.
“I have delivered that letter,” said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. “I
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?”
“That I will, and readily,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it is not dangerous.”
“Not at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.”
“What is his name?” said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in
his hand.
“Gabelle.”
“Gabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in
prison?”
“Simply, ‘that he has received the letter, and will come.’ ”
“Any time mentioned?”
“He will start upon his journey to-morrow night.”
“Any person mentioned?”
“No.”
He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and
cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old
Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. “My love to Lucie, and to little
Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry at parting, “and take precious care of them till I
come back.” Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as
the carriage rolled away.
That night—it was the fourteenth of August—he sat up late, and
wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and
213
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the
strongest assurances. To both, he wrote that he would despatch letters
in proof of his safety, immediately after his arrival.
It was a hard day, that day of being among them, with the first reservation of their joint lives on his mind. It was a hard matter to preserve
the innocent deceit of which they were profoundly unsuspicious. But,
an affectionate glance at his wife, so happy and busy, made him resolute not to tell her what impended (he had been half moved to do it,
so strange it was to him to act in anything without her quiet aid), and
the day passed quickly. Early in the evening he embraced her, and her
scarcely less dear namesake, pretending that he would return by-andbye (an imaginary engagement took him out, and he had secreted a
valise of clothes ready), and so he emerged into the heavy mist of the
heavy streets, with a heavier heart.
The unseen force was drawing him fast to itself, now, and all the
tides and winds were setting straight and strong towards it. He left
his two letters with a trusty porter, to be delivered half an hour before
midnight, and no sooner; took horse for Dover; and began his journey.
“For the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your
noble name!” was the poor prisoner’s cry with which he strengthened
his sinking heart, as he left all that was dear on earth behind him, and
floated away for the Loadstone Rock.

Book the Third
The Track of a Storm
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Chapter 1
In Secret
The traveller fared slowly on his way, who fared towards Paris from
England in the autumn of the year one thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two. More than enough of bad roads, bad equipages, and bad
horses, he would have encountered to delay him, though the fallen and
unfortunate King of France had been upon his throne in all his glory;
but, the changed times were fraught with other obstacles than these. Every town-gate and village taxing-house had its band of citizen-patriots,
with their national muskets in a most explosive state of readiness, who
stopped all comers and goers, cross-questioned them, inspected their
papers, looked for their names in lists of their own, turned them back,
or sent them on, or stopped them and laid them in hold, as their capricious judgment or fancy deemed best for the dawning Republic One and
Indivisible, of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death.
A very few French leagues of his journey were accomplished, when
Charles Darnay began to perceive that for him along these country
roads there was no hope of return until he should have been declared
a good citizen at Paris. Whatever might befall now, he must on to his
journey’s end. Not a mean village closed upon him, not a common barrier dropped across the road behind him, but he knew it to be another
iron door in the series that was barred between him and England. The
universal watchfulness so encompassed him, that if he had been taken
in a net, or were being forwarded to his destination in a cage, he could
not have felt his freedom more completely gone.
This universal watchfulness not only stopped him on the highway
twenty times in a stage, but retarded his progress twenty times in a day,
by riding after him and taking him back, riding before him and stopping
him by anticipation, riding with him and keeping him in charge. He had
been days upon his journey in France alone, when he went to bed tired
out, in a little town on the high road, still a long way from Paris.
Nothing but the production of the afflicted Gabelle’s letter from his
prison of the Abbaye would have got him on so far. His difficulty at the
guard-house in this small place had been such, that he felt his journey
to have come to a crisis. And he was, therefore, as little surprised as
a man could be, to find himself awakened at the small inn to which he
had been remitted until morning, in the middle of the night.
216
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Awakened by a timid local functionary and three armed patriots in
rough red caps and with pipes in their mouths, who sat down on the
bed.
“Emigrant,” said the functionary, “I am going to send you on to
Paris, under an escort.”
“Citizen, I desire nothing more than to get to Paris, though I could
dispense with the escort.”
“Silence!” growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the buttend of his musket. “Peace, aristocrat!”
“It is as the good patriot says,” observed the timid functionary.
“You are an aristocrat, and must have an escort—and must pay for it.”
“I have no choice,” said Charles Darnay.
“Choice! Listen to him!” cried the same scowling red-cap. “As if it
was not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!”
“It is always as the good patriot says,” observed the functionary.
“Rise and dress yourself, emigrant.”
Darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where
other patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping,
by a watch-fire. Here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on the wet, wet roads at three o’clock in the morning.
The escort were two mounted patriots in red caps and tri-coloured
cockades, armed with national muskets and sabres, who rode one on
either side of him.
The escorted governed his own horse, but a loose line was attached
to his bridle, the end of which one of the patriots kept girded round
his wrist. In this state they set forth with the sharp rain driving in their
faces: clattering at a heavy dragoon trot over the uneven town pavement,
and out upon the mire-deep roads. In this state they traversed without
change, except of horses and pace, all the mire-deep leagues that lay
between them and the capital.
They travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak,
and lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly
clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched
their ragged shoulders to keep the wet off. Apart from the personal
discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations
of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically
drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not
allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears
in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no refer217
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ence to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of
representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were
not yet made.
But when they came to the town of Beauvais—which they did at
eventide, when the streets were filled with people—he could not conceal
from himself that the aspect of affairs was very alarming. An ominous
crowd gathered to see him dismount of the posting-yard, and many
voices called out loudly, “Down with the emigrant!”
He stopped in the act of swinging himself out of his saddle, and,
resuming it as his safest place, said:
“Emigrant, my friends! Do you not see me here, in France, of my
own will?”
“You are a cursed emigrant,” cried a farrier, making at him in a
furious manner through the press, hammer in hand; “and you are a
cursed aristocrat!”
The postmaster interposed himself between this man and the rider’s
bridle (at which he was evidently making), and soothingly said, “Let
him be; let him be! He will be judged at Paris.”
“Judged!” repeated the farrier, swinging his hammer. “Ay! and
condemned as a traitor.” At this the crowd roared approval.
Checking the postmaster, who was for turning his horse’s head to
the yard (the drunken patriot sat composedly in his saddle looking on,
with the line round his wrist), Darnay said, as soon as he could make
his voice heard:
“Friends, you deceive yourselves, or you are deceived. I am not a
traitor.”
“He lies!” cried the smith. “He is a traitor since the decree. His life
is forfeit to the people. His cursed life is not his own!”
At the instant when Darnay saw a rush in the eyes of the crowd,
which another instant would have brought upon him, the postmaster turned his horse into the yard, the escort rode in close upon his
horse’s flanks, and the postmaster shut and barred the crazy double
gates. The farrier struck a blow upon them with his hammer, and the
crowd groaned; but, no more was done.
“What is this decree that the smith spoke of?” Darnay asked the
postmaster, when he had thanked him, and stood beside him in the
yard.
“Truly, a decree for selling the property of emigrants.”
“When passed?”
218
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“On the fourteenth.”
“The day I left England!”
“Everybody says it is but one of several, and that there will be
others—if there are not already-banishing all emigrants, and condemning all to death who return. That is what he meant when he said your
life was not your own.”
“But there are no such decrees yet?”
“What do I know!” said the postmaster, shrugging his shoulders;
“there may be, or there will be. It is all the same. What would you
have?”
They rested on some straw in a loft until the middle of the night,
and then rode forward again when all the town was asleep. Among the
many wild changes observable on familiar things which made this wild
ride unreal, not the least was the seeming rarity of sleep. After long
and lonely spurring over dreary roads, they would come to a cluster
of poor cottages, not steeped in darkness, but all glittering with lights,
and would find the people, in a ghostly manner in the dead of the night,
circling hand in hand round a shrivelled tree of Liberty, or all drawn up
together singing a Liberty song. Happily, however, there was sleep in
Beauvais that night to help them out of it and they passed on once more
into solitude and loneliness: jingling through the untimely cold and wet,
among impoverished fields that had yielded no fruits of the earth that
year, diversified by the blackened remains of burnt houses, and by the
sudden emergence from ambuscade, and sharp reining up across their
way, of patriot patrols on the watch on all the roads.
Daylight at last found them before the wall of Paris. The barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.
“Where are the papers of this prisoner?” demanded a resolutelooking man in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.
Naturally struck by the disagreeable word, Charles Darnay requested the speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and French
citizen, in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country
had imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.
“Where,” repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of
him whatever, “are the papers of this prisoner?”
The drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them.
Casting his eyes over Gabelle’s letter, the same personage in authority
showed some disorder and surprise, and looked at Darnay with a close
attention.
219
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He left escort and escorted without saying a word, however, and
went into the guard-room; meanwhile, they sat upon their horses outside the gate. Looking about him while in this state of suspense, Charles
Darnay observed that the gate was held by a mixed guard of soldiers and
patriots, the latter far outnumbering the former; and that while ingress
into the city for peasants’ carts bringing in supplies, and for similar traffic and traffickers, was easy enough, egress, even for the homeliest people, was very difficult. A numerous medley of men and women, not to
mention beasts and vehicles of various sorts, was waiting to issue forth;
but, the previous identification was so strict, that they filtered through
the barrier very slowly. Some of these people knew their turn for examination to be so far off, that they lay down on the ground to sleep or
smoke, while others talked together, or loitered about. The red cap and
tri-colour cockade were universal, both among men and women.
When he had sat in his saddle some half-hour, taking note of these
things, Darnay found himself confronted by the same man in authority,
who directed the guard to open the barrier. Then he delivered to the
escort, drunk and sober, a receipt for the escorted, and requested him
to dismount. He did so, and the two patriots, leading his tired horse,
turned and rode away without entering the city.
He accompanied his conductor into a guard-room, smelling of common wine and tobacco, where certain soldiers and patriots, asleep and
awake, drunk and sober, and in various neutral states between sleeping
and waking, drunkenness and sobriety, were standing and lying about.
The light in the guard-house, half derived from the waning oil-lamps
of the night, and half from the overcast day, was in a correspondingly
uncertain condition. Some registers were lying open on a desk, and an
officer of a coarse, dark aspect, presided over these.
“Citizen Defarge,” said he to Darnay’s conductor, as he took a slip
of paper to write on. “Is this the emigrant Evremonde?”
“This is the man.”
“Your age, Evremonde?”
“Thirty-seven.”
“Married, Evremonde?”
“Yes.”
“Where married?”
“In England.”
“Without doubt. Where is your wife, Evremonde?”
“In England.”
220
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Without doubt. You are consigned, Evremonde, to the prison of
La Force.”
“Just Heaven!” exclaimed Darnay. “Under what law, and for what
offence?”
The officer looked up from his slip of paper for a moment.
“We have new laws, Evremonde, and new offences, since you were
here.” He said it with a hard smile, and went on writing.
“I entreat you to observe that I have come here voluntarily, in response to that written appeal of a fellow-countryman which lies before
you. I demand no more than the opportunity to do so without delay. Is
not that my right?”
“Emigrants have no rights, Evremonde,” was the stolid reply. The
officer wrote until he had finished, read over to himself what he had
written, sanded it, and handed it to Defarge, with the words “In secret.”
Defarge motioned with the paper to the prisoner that he must accompany him. The prisoner obeyed, and a guard of two armed patriots
attended them.
“Is it you,” said Defarge, in a low voice, as they went down the
guardhouse steps and turned into Paris, “who married the daughter of
Doctor Manette, once a prisoner in the Bastille that is no more?”
“Yes,” replied Darnay, looking at him with surprise.
“My name is Defarge, and I keep a wine-shop in the Quarter Saint
Antoine. Possibly you have heard of me.”
“My wife came to your house to reclaim her father? Yes!”
The word “wife” seemed to serve as a gloomy reminder to Defarge,
to say with sudden impatience, “In the name of that sharp female newlyborn, and called La Guillotine, why did you come to France?”
“You heard me say why, a minute ago. Do you not believe it is the
truth?”
“A bad truth for you,” said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows,
and looking straight before him.
“Indeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so
sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little
help?”
“None.” Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him.
“Will you answer me a single question?”
“Perhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.”
“In this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free
communication with the world outside?”
221
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“You will see.”
“I am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of
presenting my case?”
“You will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly
buried in worse prisons, before now.”
“But never by me, Citizen Defarge.”
Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady
and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope
there was—or so Darnay thought—of his softening in any slight degree.
He, therefore, made haste to say:
“It is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better
than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate
to Mr. Lorry of Tellson’s Bank, an English gentleman who is now in
Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into
the prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?”
“I will do,” Defarge doggedly rejoined, “nothing for you. My duty
is to my country and the People. I am the sworn servant of both, against
you. I will do nothing for you.”
Charles Darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides. As they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. The very children scarcely noticed him. A few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat; otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no more
remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be going to
work. In one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they passed,
an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal family.
The few words that he caught from this man’s lips, first made it known
to Charles Darnay that the king was in prison, and that the foreign ambassadors had one and all left Paris. On the road (except at Beauvais)
he had heard absolutely nothing. The escort and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated him.
That he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left England, he of course knew now.
That perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and
faster yet, he of course knew now. He could not but admit to himself
that he might not have made this journey, if he could have foreseen
the events of a few days. And yet his misgivings were not so dark as,
222
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
imagined by the light of this later time, they would appear. Troubled
as the future was, it was the unknown future, and in its obscurity there
was ignorant hope. The horrible massacre, days and nights long, which,
within a few rounds of the clock, was to set a great mark of blood upon
the blessed garnering time of harvest, was as far out of his knowledge
as if it had been a hundred thousand years away. The “sharp female
newly-born, and called La Guillotine,” was hardly known to him, or to
the generality of people, by name. The frightful deeds that were to be
soon done, were probably unimagined at that time in the brains of the
doers. How could they have a place in the shadowy conceptions of a
gentle mind?
Of unjust treatment in detention and hardship, and in cruel separation from his wife and child, he foreshadowed the likelihood, or the
certainty; but, beyond this, he dreaded nothing distinctly. With this on
his mind, which was enough to carry into a dreary prison courtyard, he
arrived at the prison of La Force.
A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented “The Emigrant Evremonde.”
“What the Devil! How many more of them!” exclaimed the man
with the bloated face.
Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots.
“What the Devil, I say again!” exclaimed the gaoler, left with his
wife. “How many more!”
The gaoler’s wife, being provided with no answer to the question,
merely replied, “One must have patience, my dear!” Three turnkeys
who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and
one added, “For the love of Liberty;” which sounded in that place like
an inappropriate conclusion.
The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and
with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the
noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places
that are ill cared for!
“In secret, too,” grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper.
“As if I was not already full to bursting!”
He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
223
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
subordinates.
“Come!” said the chief, at length taking up his keys, “come with
me, emigrant.”
Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied
him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind
them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with
prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading
and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the
most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the
room.
In the instinctive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. But the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to receive
him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with all
the engaging graces and courtesies of life.
So strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners
and gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor
and misery through which they were seen, that Charles Darnay seemed
to stand in a company of the dead. Ghosts all! The ghost of beauty, the
ghost of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost
of frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.
It struck him motionless. The gaoler standing at his side, and the
other gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough as to
appearance in the ordinary exercise of their functions, looked so extravagantly coarse contrasted with sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters who were there—with the apparitions of the coquette, the young
beauty, and the mature woman delicately bred—that the inversion of all
experience and likelihood which the scene of shadows presented, was
heightened to its utmost. Surely, ghosts all. Surely, the long unreal ride
some progress of disease that had brought him to these gloomy shades!
“In the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,” said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, “I have
the honour of giving you welcome to La Force, and of condoling with
you on the calamity that has brought you among us. May it soon terminate happily! It would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so
here, to ask your name and condition?”
Charles Darnay roused himself, and gave the required information,
224
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in words as suitable as he could find.
“But I hope,” said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across the room, “that you are not in secret?”
“I do not understand the meaning of the term, but I have heard them
say so.”
“Ah, what a pity! We so much regret it! But take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted but
a short time.” Then he added, raising his voice, “I grieve to inform the
society—in secret.”
There was a murmur of commiseration as Charles Darnay crossed
the room to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many
voices—among which, the soft and compassionate voices of women
were conspicuous—gave him good wishes and encouragement. He
turned at the grated door, to render the thanks of his heart; it closed
under the gaoler’s hand; and the apparitions vanished from his sight
forever.
The wicket opened on a stone staircase, leading upward. When they
bad ascended forty steps (the prisoner of half an hour already counted
them), the gaoler opened a low black door, and they passed into a solitary cell. It struck cold and damp, but was not dark.
“Yours,” said the gaoler.
“Why am I confined alone?”
“How do I know!”
“I can buy pen, ink, and paper?”
“Such are not my orders. You will be visited, and can ask then. At
present, you may buy your food, and nothing more.”
There were in the cell, a chair, a table, and a straw mattress. As
the gaoler made a general inspection of these objects, and of the four
walls, before going out, a wandering fancy wandered through the mind
of the prisoner leaning against the wall opposite to him, that this gaoler
was so unwholesomely bloated, both in face and person, as to look like
a man who had been drowned and filled with water. When the gaoler
was gone, he thought in the same wandering way, “Now am I left, as if
I were dead.” Stopping then, to look down at the mattress, he turned
from it with a sick feeling, and thought, “And here in these crawling
creatures is the first condition of the body after death.”
“Five paces by four and a half, five paces by four and a half, five
paces by four and a half.” The prisoner walked to and fro in his cell,
counting its measurement, and the roar of the city arose like muffled
225
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
drums with a wild swell of voices added to them. “He made shoes, he
made shoes, he made shoes.” The prisoner counted the measurement
again, and paced faster, to draw his mind with him from that latter repetition. “The ghosts that vanished when the wicket closed. There was
one among them, the appearance of a lady dressed in black, who was
leaning in the embrasure of a window, and she had a light shining upon
her golden hair, and she looked like * * * * Let us ride on again, for
God’s sake, through the illuminated villages with the people all awake!
* * * * He made shoes, he made shoes, he made shoes. * * * * Five
paces by four and a half.” With such scraps tossing and rolling upward
from the depths of his mind, the prisoner walked faster and faster, obstinately counting and counting; and the roar of the city changed to this
extent—that it still rolled in like muffled drums, but with the wail of
voices that he knew, in the swell that rose above them.
Chapter 2
The Grindstone
Tellson’s Bank, established in the Saint Germain Quarter of Paris, was in
a wing of a large house, approached by a courtyard and shut off from
the street by a high wall and a strong gate. The house belonged to a
great nobleman who had lived in it until he made a flight from the troubles, in his own cook’s dress, and got across the borders. A mere beast
of the chase flying from hunters, he was still in his metempsychosis no
other than the same Monseigneur, the preparation of whose chocolate
for whose lips had once occupied three strong men besides the cook in
question.
Monseigneur gone, and the three strong men absolving themselves
from the sin of having drawn his high wages, by being more than ready
and willing to cut his throat on the altar of the dawning Republic one
and indivisible of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, Monseigneur’s
house had been first sequestrated, and then confiscated. For, all things
moved so fast, and decree followed decree with that fierce precipitation,
that now upon the third night of the autumn month of September, patriot emissaries of the law were in possession of Monseigneur’s house,
and had marked it with the tri-colour, and were drinking brandy in its
state apartments.
226
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
A place of business in London like Tellson’s place of business in Paris,
would soon have driven the House out of its mind and into the Gazette.
For, what would staid British responsibility and respectability have said
to orange-trees in boxes in a Bank courtyard, and even to a Cupid over
the counter? Yet such things were. Tellson’s had whitewashed the Cupid,
but he was still to be seen on the ceiling, in the coolest linen, aiming (as
he very often does) at money from morning to night. Bankruptcy must
inevitably have come of this young Pagan, in Lombard-street, London,
and also of a curtained alcove in the rear of the immortal boy, and also
of a looking-glass let into the wall, and also of clerks not at all old, who
danced in public on the slightest provocation. Yet, a French Tellson’s
could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the
times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out
his money.
What money would be drawn out of Tellson’s henceforth, and what
would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish
in Tellson’s hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and
when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with
Tellson’s never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into
the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis
Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by
a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper
shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room
distortedly reflect—a shade of horror.
He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which
he had grown to be a part, lie strong root-ivy. it chanced that they
derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main
building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that.
All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty.
On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive
standing—for carriages—where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur
yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring
flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was
a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have
hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other
workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects,
Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire. He had opened,
not only the glass window, but the lattice blind outside it, and he had
227
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
closed both again, and he shivered through his frame.
From the streets beyond the high wall and the strong gate, there
came the usual night hum of the city, with now and then an indescribable ring in it, weird and unearthly, as if some unwonted sounds of a
terrible nature were going up to Heaven.
“Thank God,” said Mr. Lorry, clasping his hands, “that no one near
and dear to me is in this dreadful town to-night. May He have mercy
on all who are in danger!”
Soon afterwards, the bell at the great gate sounded, and he thought,
“They have come back!” and sat listening. But, there was no loud
irruption into the courtyard, as he had expected, and he heard the gate
clash again, and all was quiet.
The nervousness and dread that were upon him inspired that vague
uneasiness respecting the Bank, which a great change would naturally
awaken, with such feelings roused. It was well guarded, and he got up
to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door
suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell
back in amazement.
Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and
with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it
seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give
force and power to it in this one passage of her life.
“What is this?” cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. “What is
the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought
you here? What is it?”
With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she
panted out in his arms, imploringly, “O my dear friend! My husband!”
“Your husband, Lucie?”
“Charles.”
“What of Charles?”
“Here.
“Here, in Paris?”
“Has been here some days—three or four—I don’t know how
many—I can’t collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought
him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to
prison.”
The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the beg of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and
voices came pouring into the courtyard.
228
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“What is that noise?” said the Doctor, turning towards the window.
“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry. “Don’t look out! Manette, for your
life, don’t touch the blind!”
The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window,
and said, with a cool, bold smile:
“My dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a
Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris—in Paris? In France—
who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch
me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph.
My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the
barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I
knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger;
I told Lucie so.—What is that noise?” His hand was again upon the
window.
“Don’t look!” cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. “No, Lucie,
my dear, nor you!” He got his arm round her, and held her. “Don’t be
so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm
having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being
in this fatal place. What prison is he in?”
“La Force!”
“La Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable
in your life—and you were always both—you will compose yourself
now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can
think, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part
to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must
bid you to do for Charles’s sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You
must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in
a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for
two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not
delay.”
“I will be submissive to you. I see in your face that you know I can
do nothing else than this. I know you are true.”
The old man kissed her, and hurried her into his room, and turned
the key; then, came hurrying back to the Doctor, and opened the window and partly opened the blind, and put his hand upon the Doctor’s
arm, and looked out with him into the courtyard.
Looked out upon a throng of men and women: not enough in number, or near enough, to fill the courtyard: not more than forty or fifty
in all. The people in possession of the house had let them in at the gate,
229
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and they had rushed in to work at the grindstone; it had evidently been
set up there for their purpose, as in a convenient and retired spot.
But, such awful workers, and such awful work!
The grindstone had a double handle, and, turning at it madly
were two men, whose faces, as their long hair Rapped back when the
whirlings of the grindstone brought their faces up, were more horrible
and cruel than the visages of the wildest savages in their most barbarous
disguise. False eyebrows and false moustaches were stuck upon them,
and their hideous countenances were all bloody and sweaty, and all
awry with howling, and all staring and glaring with beastly excitement
and want of sleep. As these ruffians turned and turned, their matted
locks now flung forward over their eyes, now flung backward over their
necks, some women held wine to their mouths that they might drink;
and what with dropping blood, and what with dropping wine, and what
with the stream of sparks struck out of the stone, all their wicked atmosphere seemed gore and fire. The eye could not detect one creature in
the group free from the smear of blood. Shouldering one another to
get next at the sharpening-stone, were men stripped to the waist, with
the stain all over their limbs and bodies; men in all sorts of rags, with
the stain upon those rags; men devilishly set off with spoils of women’s
lace and silk and ribbon, with the stain dyeing those trifles through and
through. Hatchets, knives, bayonets, swords, all brought to be sharpened, were all red with it. Some of the hacked swords were tied to the
wrists of those who carried them, with strips of linen and fragments of
dress: ligatures various in kind, but all deep of the one colour. And as
the frantic wielders of these weapons snatched them from the stream of
sparks and tore away into the streets, the same red hue was red in their
frenzied eyes;—eyes which any unbrutalised beholder would have given
twenty years of life, to petrify with a well-directed gun.
All this was seen in a moment, as the vision of a drowning man, or
of any human creature at any very great pass, could see a world if it
were there. They drew back from the window, and the Doctor looked
for explanation in his friend’s ashy face.
“They are,” Mr. Lorry whispered the words, glancing fearfully
round at the locked room, “murdering the prisoners. If you are sure
of what you say; if you really have the power you think you have—as I
believe you have—make yourself known to these devils, and get taken
to La Force. It may be too late, I don’t know, but let it not be a minute
later!”
230
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the
room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind.
His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous
confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For
a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and
the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked
shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of—
“Live the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner’s kindred in La
Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner
Evremonde at La Force!” and a thousand answering shouts.
He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found
her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew.
Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge. O the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! And
O the long, long night, with no return of her father and no tidings!
Twice more in the darkness the bell at the great gate sounded, and
the irruption was repeated, and the grindstone whirled and spluttered.
“What is it?” cried Lucie, affrighted. “Hush! The soldiers’ swords are
sharpened there,” said Mr. Lorry. “The place is national property now,
and used as a kind of armoury, my love.”
Twice more in all; but, the last spell of work was feeble and fitful.
Soon afterwards the day began to dawn, and he softly detached himself
from the clasping hand, and cautiously looked out again. A man, so
besmeared that he might have been a sorely wounded soldier creeping
back to consciousness on a field of slain, was rising from the pavement
by the side of the grindstone, and looking about him with a vacant air.
Shortly, this worn-out murderer descried in the imperfect light one of
the carriages of Monseigneur, and, staggering to that gorgeous vehicle,
climbed in at the door, and shut himself up to take his rest on its dainty
cushions.
The great grindstone, Earth, had turned when Mr. Lorry looked out
231
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
again, and the sun was red on the courtyard. But, the lesser grindstone
stood alone there in the calm morning air, with a red upon it that the
sun had never given, and would never take away.
Chapter 3
The Shadow
One of the first considerations which arose in the business mind of Mr.
Lorry when business hours came round, was this:—that he had no right
to imperil Tellson’s by sheltering the wife of an emigrant prisoner under
the Bank roof, His own possessions, safety, life, he would have hazarded
for Lucie and her child, without a moment’s demur; but the great trust
he held was not his own, and as to that business charge he was a strict
man of business.
At first, his mind reverted to Defarge, and he thought of finding
out the wine-shop again and taking counsel with its master in reference
to the safest dwelling-place in the distracted state of the city. But, the
same consideration that suggested him, repudiated him; he lived in the
most violent Quarter, and doubtless was influential there, and deep in
its dangerous workings.
Noon coming, and the Doctor not returning, and every minute’s delay tending to compromise Tellson’s, Mr. Lorry advised with Lucie. She
said that her father had spoken of hiring a lodging for a short term, in
that Quarter, near the Banking-house. As there was no business objection to this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with Charles,
and he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, Mr. Lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.
To this lodging he at once removed Lucie and her child, and Miss
Pross: giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he
had himself. He left Jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that
would bear considerable knocking on the head, and retained to his own
occupations. A disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon
them, and slowly and heavily the day lagged on with him.
It wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the Bank closed.
He was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what
232
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
to do next, when he heard a foot upon the stair. In a few moments, a
man stood in his presence, who, with a keenly observant look at him,
addressed him by his name.
“Your servant,” said Mr. Lorry. “Do you know me?”
He was a strongly made man with dark curling hair, from forty-five
to fifty years of age. For answer he repeated, without any change of
emphasis, the words:
“Do you know me?”
“I have seen you somewhere.”
“Perhaps at my wine-shop?”
Much interested and agitated, Mr. Lorry said: “You come from Doctor Manette?”
“Yes. I come from Doctor Manette.”
“And what says he? What does he send me?”
Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore
the words in the Doctor’s writing:
“Charles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I
have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note
from Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife.”
It was dated from La Force, within an hour.
“Will you accompany me,” said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after
reading this note aloud, “to where his wife resides?”
“Yes,” returned Defarge.
Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical
way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into
the courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting.
“Madame Defarge, surely!” said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in
exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago.
“It is she,” observed her husband.
“Does Madame go with us?” inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she
moved as they moved.
“Yes. That she may be able to recognise the faces and know the
persons. It is for their safety.”
Beginning to be struck by Defarge’s manner, Mr. Lorry looked dubiously at him, and led the way. Both the women followed; the second
woman being The Vengeance.
They passed through the intervening streets as quickly as they might,
ascended the staircase of the new domicile, were admitted by Jerry, and
233
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
found Lucie weeping, alone. She was thrown into a transport by the
tidings Mr. Lorry gave her of her husband, and clasped the hand that
delivered his note—little thinking what it had been doing near him in
the night, and might, but for a chance, have done to him.
“Dearest,—Take courage. I am well, and your father has
influence around me. You cannot answer this. Kiss our child
for me.”
That was all the writing. It was so much, however, to her who
received it, that she turned from Defarge to his wife, and kissed one of
the hands that knitted. It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly
action, but the hand made no response—dropped cold and heavy, and
took to its knitting again.
There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She
stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands
yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge
met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare.
“My dear,” said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; “there are frequent
risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble
you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to
protect at such times, to the end that she may know them—that she may
identify them. I believe,” said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring
words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him
more and more, “I state the case, Citizen Defarge?”
Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than
a gruff sound of acquiescence.
“You had better, Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, “have the dear child here, and our good Pross.
Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.”
The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more
than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and,
danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The
Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, “Well, I am sure, Boldface! I hope you are pretty well!” She also bestowed a British cough on
Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.
“Is that his child?” said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for
the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were
the finger of Fate.
234
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes, madame,” answered Mr. Lorry; “this is our poor prisoner’s
darling daughter, and only child.”
The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed
to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The
shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to
fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child.
“It is enough, my husband,” said Madame Defarge. “I have seen
them. We may go.”
But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it—not visible
and presented, but indistinct and withheld—to alarm Lucie into saying,
as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge’s dress:
“You will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm.
You will help me to see him if you can?”
“Your husband is not my business here,” returned Madame Defarge,
looking down at her with perfect composure. “It is the daughter of your
father who is my business here.”
“For my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child’s sake!
She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are
more afraid of you than of these others.”
Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her
husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and
looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.
“What is it that your husband says in that little letter?” asked
Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile. “Influence; he says something
touching influence?”
“That my father,” said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her
breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, “has
much influence around him.”
“Surely it will release him!” said Madame Defarge. “Let it do so.”
“As a wife and mother,” cried Lucie, most earnestly, “I implore you
to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess,
against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman,
think of me. As a wife and mother!”
Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said,
turning to her friend The Vengeance:
“The wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were
as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered?
We have known their husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from
235
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
them, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer,
in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst,
sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?”
“We have seen nothing else,” returned The Vengeance.
“We have borne this a long time,” said Madame Defarge, turning
her eyes again upon Lucie. “Judge you! Is it likely that the trouble of
one wife and mother would be much to us now?”
She resumed her knitting and went out. The Vengeance followed.
Defarge went last, and closed the door.
“Courage, my dear Lucie,” said Mr. Lorry, as he raised her.
“Courage, courage! So far all goes well with us—much, much better
than it has of late gone with many poor souls. Cheer up, and have a
thankful heart.”
“I am not thankless, I hope, but that dreadful woman seems to throw
a shadow on me and on all my hopes.”
“Tut, tut!” said Mr. Lorry; “what is this despondency in the brave
little breast? A shadow indeed! No substance in it, Lucie.”
But the shadow of the manner of these Defarges was dark upon
himself, for all that, and in his secret mind it troubled him greatly.
Chapter 4
Calm in Storm
Doctor Manette did not return until the morning of the fourth day of
his absence. So much of what had happened in that dreadful time as
could be kept from the knowledge of Lucie was so well concealed from
her, that not until long afterwards, when France and she were far apart,
did she know that eleven hundred defenceless prisoners of both sexes
and all ages had been killed by the populace; that four days and nights
had been darkened by this deed of horror; and that the air around her
had been tainted by the slain. She only knew that there had been an
attack upon the prisons, that all political prisoners had been in danger,
and that some had been dragged out by the crowd and murdered.
To Mr. Lorry, the Doctor communicated under an injunction of secrecy on which he had no need to dwell, that the crowd had taken him
through a scene of carnage to the prison of La Force. That, in the prison
he had found a self-appointed Tribunal sitting, before which the prison236
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ers were brought singly, and by which they were rapidly ordered to be
put forth to be massacred, or to be released, or (in a few cases) to be sent
back to their cells. That, presented by his conductors to this Tribunal,
he had announced himself by name and profession as having been for
eighteen years a secret and unaccused prisoner in the Bastille; that, one
of the body so sitting in judgment had risen and identified him, and that
this man was Defarge.
That, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table, that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded
hard to the Tribunal—of whom some members were asleep and some
awake, some dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some
not—for his life and liberty. That, in the first frantic greetings lavished
on himself as a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had
been accorded to him to have Charles Darnay brought before the lawless Court, and examined. That, he seemed on the point of being at
once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained
check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed
Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should,
for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on
a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again;
but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to
remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice
or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside
the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the
permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger
was over.
The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by
intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were
saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against
those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who
had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage
had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and
dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had
found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated
on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as
anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended
the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude—had made a litter for
him and escorted him carefully from the spot—had then caught up their
237
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor
had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of
it.
As Mr. Lorry received these confidences, and as he watched the face
of his friend now sixty-two years of age, a misgiving arose within him
that such dread experiences would revive the old danger.
But, he had never seen his friend in his present aspect: he had never
at all known him in his present character. For the first time the Doctor
felt, now, that his suffering was strength and power. For the first time
he felt that in that sharp fire, he had slowly forged the iron which could
break the prison door of his daughter’s husband, and deliver him. “It
all tended to a good end, my friend; it was not mere waste and ruin. As
my beloved child was helpful in restoring me to myself, I will be helpful
now in restoring the dearest part of herself to her; by the aid of Heaven
I will do it!” Thus, Doctor Manette. And when Jarvis Lorry saw the
kindled eyes, the resolute face, the calm strong look and bearing of the
man whose life always seemed to him to have been stopped, like a clock,
for so many years, and then set going again with an energy which had
lain dormant during the cessation of its usefulness, he believed.
Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with,
would have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of
mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of
three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie
that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with
the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought
sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband
himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor’s hand), but she
was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions
of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were
known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad.
This new life of the Doctor’s was an anxious life, no doubt; still,
the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.
Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one;
but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time,
his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and
his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now
that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that
238
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles’s ultimate
safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he
took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to
him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could
reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some
service to her who had rendered so much to him. “All curious to see,”
thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, “but all natural and
right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn’t be in
better hands.”
But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the
public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era
began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against
the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great
towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France,
as if the dragon’s teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit
equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the
bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and
forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped
grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad
rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could
rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty—the deluge
rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of
Heaven shut, not opened!
There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest,
no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as
when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day,
other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging
fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the
unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the
head of the king—and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the
head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned
widowhood and misery, to turn it grey.
And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains
in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary
239
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away
all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent
person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had
committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became
the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be
ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous
figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from
the foundations of the world—the figure of the sharp female called La
Guillotine.
It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache,
it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar
delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved
close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and
sneezed into the sack. It was the sign of the regeneration of the human
race. It superseded the Cross. Models of it were worn on breasts from
which the Cross was discarded, and it was bowed down to and believed
in where the Cross was denied.
It sheared off heads so many, that it, and the ground it most polluted, were a rotten red. It was taken to pieces, like a toy-puzzle for a
young Devil, and was put together again when the occasion wanted it. It
hushed the eloquent, struck down the powerful, abolished the beautiful
and good. Twenty-two friends of high public mark, twenty-one living
and one dead, it had lopped the heads off, in one morning, in as many
minutes. The name of the strong man of Old Scripture had descended
to the chief functionary who worked it; but, so armed, he was stronger
than his namesake, and blinder, and tore away the gates of God’s own
Temple every day.
Among these terrors, and the brood belonging to them, the Doctor
walked with a steady head: confident in his power, cautiously persistent
in his end, never doubting that he would save Lucie’s husband at last.
Yet the current of the time swept by, so strong and deep, and carried
the time away so fiercely, that Charles had lain in prison one year and
three months when the Doctor was thus steady and confident. So much
more wicked and distracted had the Revolution grown in that December
month, that the rivers of the South were encumbered with the bodies of
the violently drowned by night, and prisoners were shot in lines and
squares under the southern wintry sun. Still, the Doctor walked among
the terrors with a steady head. No man better known than he, in Paris at
that day; no man in a stranger situation. Silent, humane, indispensable
240
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in hospital and prison, using his art equally among assassins and victims,
he was a man apart. In the exercise of his skill, the appearance and the
story of the Bastille Captive removed him from all other men. He was
not suspected or brought in question, any more than if he had indeed
been recalled to life some eighteen years before, or were a Spirit moving
among mortals.
Chapter 5
The Wood-Sawyer
One year and three months. During all that time Lucie was never sure,
from hour to hour, but that the Guillotine would strike off her husband’s head next day. Every day, through the stony streets, the tumbrils
now jolted heavily, filled with Condemned. Lovely girls; bright women,
brown-haired, black-haired, and grey; youths; stalwart men and old;
gentle born and peasant born; all red wine for La Guillotine, all daily
brought into light from the dark cellars of the loathsome prisons, and
carried to her through the streets to slake her devouring thirst. Liberty,
equality, fraternity, or death;—the last, much the easiest to bestow, O
Guillotine!
If the suddenness of her calamity, and the whirling wheels of the
time, had stunned the Doctor’s daughter into awaiting the result in idle
despair, it would but have been with her as it was with many. But, from
the hour when she had taken the white head to her fresh young bosom
in the garret of Saint Antoine, she had been true to her duties. She was
truest to them in the season of trial, as all the quietly loyal and good
will always be.
As soon as they were established in their new residence, and her father had entered on the routine of his avocations, she arranged the little
household as exactly as if her husband had been there. Everything had
its appointed place and its appointed time. Little Lucie she taught, as
regularly, as if they had all been united in their English home. The slight
devices with which she cheated herself into the show of a belief that
they would soon be reunited—the little preparations for his speedy return, the setting aside of his chair and his books—these, and the solemn
prayer at night for one dear prisoner especially, among the many un241
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
happy souls in prison and the shadow of death—were almost the only
outspoken reliefs of her heavy mind.
She did not greatly alter in appearance. The plain dark dresses, akin
to mourning dresses, which she and her child wore, were as neat and
as well attended to as the brighter clothes of happy days. She lost her
colour, and the old and intent expression was a constant, not an occasional, thing; otherwise, she remained very pretty and comely. Sometimes, at night on kissing her father, she would burst into the grief
she had repressed all day, and would say that her sole reliance, under
Heaven, was on him. He always resolutely answered: “Nothing can
happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him,
Lucie.”
They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks,
when her father said to her, on coming home one evening:
“My dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles
can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to
it—which depends on many uncertainties and incidents—he might see
you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can
show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even
if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.”
“O show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.”
From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the
clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away.
When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they
went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a
single day.
It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel
of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that
end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed
her.
“Good day, citizeness.”
“Good day, citizen.”
This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots;
but, was now law for everybody.
“Walking here again, citizeness?”
“You see me, citizen!”
The wood-sawyer, who was a little man with a redundancy of gesture (he had once been a mender of roads), cast a glance at the prison,
242
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
pointed at the prison, and putting his ten fingers before his face to represent bars, peeped through them jocosely.
“But it’s not my business,” said he. And went on sawing his wood.
Next day he was looking out for her, and accosted her the moment
she appeared.
“What? Walking here again, citizeness?”
“Yes, citizen.”
“Ah! A child too! Your mother, is it not, my little citizeness?”
“Do I say yes, mamma?” whispered little Lucie, drawing close to
her.
“Yes, dearest.”
“Yes, citizen.”
“Ah! But it’s not my business. My work is my business. See my
saw! I call it my Little Guillotine. La, la, la; La, la, la! And off his head
comes!”
The billet fell as he spoke, and he threw it into a basket.
“I call myself the Samson of the firewood guillotine. See here again!
Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off her head comes! Now, a child.
Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off its head comes. All the family!”
Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it
was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not
be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke
to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received.
He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite
forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her
heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking
at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. “But
it’s not my business!” he would generally say at those times, and would
briskly fall to his sawing again.
In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds
of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and
again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every
day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.
Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once
in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not
for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did
see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have
waited out the day, seven days a week.
These occupations brought her round to the December month,
243
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On
a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a
day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses,
as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps
stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One
and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death!
The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole
surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got
somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death
in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed
pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed
his saw inscribed as his “Little Sainte Guillotine”—for the great sharp
female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he
was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone.
But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement
and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the
prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand
with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people,
and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other
music than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution
song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison. Men and women danced together, women danced together, men
danced together, as hazard had brought them together. At first, they
were a mere storm of coarse red caps and coarse woollen rags; but, as
they filled the place, and stopped to dance about Lucie, some ghastly
apparition of a dance-figure gone raving mad arose among them. They
advanced, retreated, struck at one another’s hands, clutched at one another’s heads, spun round alone, caught one another and spun round
in pairs, until many of them dropped. While those were down, the rest
linked hand in hand, and all spun round together: then the ring broke,
and in separate rings of two and four they turned and turned until they
all stopped at once, began again, struck, clutched, and tore, and then reversed the spin, and all spun round another way. Suddenly they stopped
again, paused, struck out the time afresh, formed into lines the width
of the public way, and, with their heads low down and their hands high
up, swooped screaming off. No fight could have been half so terrible
as this dance. It was so emphatically a fallen sport—a something, once
244
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
innocent, delivered over to all devilry—a healthy pastime changed into
a means of angering the blood, bewildering the senses, and steeling the
heart. Such grace as was visible in it, made it the uglier, showing how
warped and perverted all things good by nature were become. The maidenly bosom bared to this, the pretty almost-child’s head thus distracted,
the delicate foot mincing in this slough of blood and dirt, were types of
the disjointed time.
This was the Carmagnole. As it passed, leaving Lucie frightened and
bewildered in the doorway of the wood-sawyer’s house, the feathery
snow fell as quietly and lay as white and soft, as if it had never been.
“O my father!” for he stood before her when she lifted up the eyes
she had momentarily darkened with her hand; “such a cruel, bad sight.”
“I know, my dear, I know. I have seen it many times. Don’t be
frightened! Not one of them would harm you.”
“I am not frightened for myself, my father. But when I think of my
husband, and the mercies of these people—”
“We will set him above their mercies very soon. I left him climbing
to the window, and I came to tell you. There is no one here to see. You
may kiss your hand towards that highest shelving roof.”
“I do so, father, and I send him my Soul with it!”
“You cannot see him, my poor dear?”
“No, father,” said Lucie, yearning and weeping as she kissed her
hand, “no.”
A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. “I salute you, citizeness,”
from the Doctor. “I salute you, citizen.” This in passing. Nothing more.
Madame Defarge gone, like a shadow over the white road.
“Give me your arm, my love. Pass from here with an air of cheerfulness and courage, for his sake. That was well done;” they had left the
spot; “it shall not be in vain. Charles is summoned for to-morrow.”
“For to-morrow!”
“There is no time to lose. I am well prepared, but there are precautions to be taken, that could not be taken until he was actually summoned before the Tribunal. He has not received the notice yet, but I
know that he will presently be summoned for to-morrow, and removed
to the Conciergerie; I have timely information. You are not afraid?”
She could scarcely answer, “I trust in you.”
“Do so, implicitly. Your suspense is nearly ended, my darling; he
shall be restored to you within a few hours; I have encompassed him
with every protection. I must see Lorry.”
245
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
He stopped. There was a heavy lumbering of wheels within hearing.
They both knew too well what it meant. One. Two. Three. Three
tumbrils faring away with their dread loads over the hushing snow.
“I must see Lorry,” the Doctor repeated, turning her another way.
The staunch old gentleman was still in his trust; had never left it. He
and his books were in frequent requisition as to property confiscated
and made national. What he could save for the owners, he saved. No
better man living to hold fast by what Tellson’s had in keeping, and to
hold his peace.
A murky red and yellow sky, and a rising mist from the Seine, denoted the approach of darkness. It was almost dark when they arrived at
the Bank. The stately residence of Monseigneur was altogether blighted
and deserted. Above a heap of dust and ashes in the court, ran the letters: National Property. Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity, or Death!
Who could that be with Mr. Lorry—the owner of the riding-coat
upon the chair—who must not be seen? From whom newly arrived, did
he come out, agitated and surprised, to take his favourite in his arms?
To whom did he appear to repeat her faltering words, when, raising his
voice and turning his head towards the door of the room from which he
had issued, he said: “Removed to the Conciergerie, and summoned for
to-morrow?”
Chapter 6
Triumph
The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined
Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read
out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard
gaoler-joke was, “Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside
there!”
“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay!”
So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.
When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he
had seen hundreds pass away so.
246
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over
them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through
the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twentythree names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had
already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted
chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night
of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every
human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the
scaffold.
There were hurried words of farewell and kindness, but the parting
was soon over. It was the incident of every day, and the society of La
Force were engaged in the preparation of some games of forfeits and
a little concert, for that evening. They crowded to the grates and shed
tears there; but, twenty places in the projected entertainments had to
be refilled, and the time was, at best, short to the lock-up hour, when
the common rooms and corridors would be delivered over to the great
dogs who kept watch there through the night. The prisoners were far
from insensible or unfeeling; their ways arose out of the condition of the
time. Similarly, though with a subtle difference, a species of fervour or
intoxication, known, without doubt, to have led some persons to brave
the guillotine unnecessarily, and to die by it, was not mere boastfulness,
but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. In seasons of
pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the disease—a
terrible passing inclination to die of it. And all of us have like wonders
hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke them.
The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in
its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners
were put to the bar before Charles Darnay’s name was called. All the
fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour
and a half.
“Charles Evremonde, called Darnay,” was at length arraigned.
His judges sat upon the Bench in feathered hats; but the rough red
cap and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing.
Looking at the Jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought
that the usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were
trying the honest men. The lowest, cruelest, and worst populace of a
city, never without its quantity of low, cruel, and bad, were the directing spirits of the scene: noisily commenting, applauding, disapproving,
247
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
anticipating, and precipitating the result, without a check. Of the men,
the greater part were armed in various ways; of the women, some wore
knives, some daggers, some ate and drank as they looked on, many knitted. Among these last, was one, with a spare piece of knitting under her
arm as she worked. She was in a front row, by the side of a man whom
he had never seen since his arrival at the Barrier, but whom he directly
remembered as Defarge. He noticed that she once or twice whispered in
his ear, and that she seemed to be his wife; but, what he most noticed in
the two figures was, that although they were posted as close to himself
as they could be, they never looked towards him. They seemed to be
waiting for something with a dogged determination, and they looked at
the Jury, but at nothing else. Under the President sat Doctor Manette,
in his usual quiet dress. As well as the prisoner could see, he and Mr.
Lorry were the only men there, unconnected with the Tribunal, who
wore their usual clothes, and had not assumed the coarse garb of the
Carmagnole.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the
decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing
that the decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and
there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was
demanded.
“Take off his head!” cried the audience. “An enemy to the Republic!”
The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?
Undoubtedly it was.
Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself?
Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.
Why not? the President desired to know.
Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to
him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country—
he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the
Tribunal was in use—to live by his own industry in England, rather than
on the industry of the overladen people of France.
What proof had he of this?
He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and
Alexandre Manette.
But he had married in England? the President reminded him.
248
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
True, but not an English woman.
A citizeness of France?
Yes. By birth.
Her name and family?
“Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.”
This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously
were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment
before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill
him.
On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his
foot according to Doctor Manette’s reiterated instructions. The same
cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.
The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did,
and not sooner?
He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no
means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature.
He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of
a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his
absence. He had come back, to save a citizen’s life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal in
the eyes of the Republic?
The populace cried enthusiastically, “No!” and the President rang
his bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry “No!”
until they left off, of their own will.
The President required the name of that citizen. The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence to the citizen’s letter, which had been taken from him at the
Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers
then before the President.
The Doctor had taken care that it should be there—had assured him
that it would be there—and at this stage of the proceedings it was produced and read. Citizen Gabelle was called to confirm it, and did so.
Citizen Gabelle hinted, with infinite delicacy and politeness, that in the
pressure of business imposed on the Tribunal by the multitude of en249
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
emies of the Republic with which it had to deal, he had been slightly
overlooked in his prison of the Abbaye—in fact, had rather passed out
of the Tribunal’s patriotic remembrance—until three days ago; when he
had been summoned before it, and had been set at liberty on the Jury’s
declaring themselves satisfied that the accusation against him was answered, as to himself, by the surrender of the citizen Evremonde, called
Darnay.
Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity,
and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release
from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England,
always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile;
that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there,
he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and
friend of the United States—as he brought these circumstances into view,
with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth
and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when
he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and
there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial
and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had
heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President
were content to receive them.
At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner’s
favour, and the President declared him free.
Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards
generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set-off against
their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which
of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable,
to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner
was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood
at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the
prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his
long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from
exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same
people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the
very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.
His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to
250
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were
to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as
they had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to
compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came
down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twentyfour hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison
sign of Death—a raised finger—and they all added in words, “Long live
the Republic!”
The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings,
for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a
great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen
in Court—except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out,
the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all
by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of
which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on
the shore.
They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which
they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or
passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of
it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph,
not even the Doctor’s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his
home on men’s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about
him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces,
that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and
that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.
In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the
prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them,
as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the courtyard of the building where he lived. Her
father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood
upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.
As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between
his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might
come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all
the rest fell to dancing, and the courtyard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from
the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and
overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river’s bank, and
251
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled
them away.
After grasping the Doctor’s hand, as he stood victorious and proud
before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in
breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole;
after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his
neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted
her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms.
“Lucie! My own! I am safe.”
“O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have
prayed to Him.”
They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. When she was
again in his arms, he said to her:
“And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this
France could have done what he has done for me.”
She laid her head upon her father’s breast, as she had laid his poor
head on her own breast, long, long ago. He was happy in the return
he had made her, he was recompensed for his suffering, he was proud
of his strength. “You must not be weak, my darling,” he remonstrated;
“don’t tremble so. I have saved him.”
Chapter 7
A Knock at the Door
“I have saved him.” It was not another of the dreams in which he had
often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a
vague but heavy fear was upon her.
All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death
on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that
many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to
her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her
heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The
shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now
the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued
them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer
to his real presence and trembled more.
252
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this
woman’s weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had
saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him.
Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that
was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but
because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment,
had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards
the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly
to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness
who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional
service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had
become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.
It was an ordinance of the Republic One and Indivisible of Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity, or Death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. Mr.
Jerry Cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom Doctor Manette
had employed to add to the list the name of Charles Evremonde, called
Darnay.
In the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. In the Doctor’s little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. To avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.
For some months past, Miss Pross and Mr. Cruncher had discharged
the office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket. Every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home such
purchases as were needful. Although Miss Pross, through her long association with a French family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of that “nonsense” (as she
was pleased to call it) than Mr. Cruncher did. So her manner of marketing was to plump a noun-substantive at the head of a shopkeeper
253
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
without any introduction in the nature of an article, and, if it happened
not to be the name of the thing she wanted, to look round for that thing,
lay hold of it, and hold on by it until the bargain was concluded. She
always made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just
price, one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number
might be.
“Now, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose eyes were red with
felicity; “if you are ready, I am.”
Jerry hoarsely professed himself at Miss Pross’s service. He had
worn all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head
down.
“There’s all manner of things wanted,” said Miss Pross, “and we
shall have a precious time of it. We want wine, among the rest. Nice
toasts these Redheads will be drinking, wherever we buy it.”
“It will be much the same to your knowledge, miss, I should think,”
retorted Jerry, “whether they drink your health or the Old Un’s.”
“Who’s he?” said Miss Pross.
Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning
“Old Nick’s.”
“Ha!” said Miss Pross, “it doesn’t need an interpreter to explain
the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it’s Midnight
Murder, and Mischief.”
“Hush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!” cried Lucie.
“Yes, yes, yes, I’ll be cautious,” said Miss Pross; “but I may say
among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey
smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets.
Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care
of the dear husband you have recovered, and don’t move your pretty
head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I
ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?”
“I think you may take that liberty,” the Doctor answered, smiling.
“For gracious sake, don’t talk about Liberty; we have quite enough
of that,” said Miss Pross.
“Hush, dear! Again?” Lucie remonstrated.
“Well, my sweet,” said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically,
“the short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;” Miss Pross curtseyed at the
name; “and as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate
their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!”
254
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after Miss Pross, like somebody at church.
“I am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though
I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,” said Miss Pross,
approvingly. “But the question, Doctor Manette. Is there”—it was the
good creature’s way to affect to make light of anything that was a great
anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner—“is there
any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?”
“I fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.”
“Heigh-ho-hum!” said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as
she glanced at her darling’s golden hair in the light of the fire, “then we
must have patience and wait: that’s all. We must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!—
Don’t you move, Ladybird!”
They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the
child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the
Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside
in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie
sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he,
in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of
a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out
a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and
quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been.
“What is that?” she cried, all at once.
“My dear!” said her father, stopping in his story, and laying his
hand on hers, “command yourself. What a disordered state you are in!
The least thing—nothing—startles you! You, your father’s daughter!”
“I thought, my father,” said Lucie, excusing herself, with a pale face
and in a faltering voice, “that I heard strange feet upon the stairs.”
“My love, the staircase is as still as Death.”
As he said the word, a blow was struck upon the door.
“Oh father, father. What can this be! Hide Charles. Save him!”
“My child,” said the Doctor, rising, and laying his hand upon her
shoulder, “I have saved him. What weakness is this, my dear! Let me
go to the door.”
He took the lamp in his hand, crossed the two intervening outer
rooms, and opened it. A rude clattering of feet over the floor, and four
rough men in red caps, armed with sabres and pistols, entered the room.
“The Citizen Evremonde, called Darnay,” said the first.
255
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Who seeks him?” answered Darnay.
“I seek him. We seek him. I know you, Evremonde; I saw you before
the Tribunal to-day. You are again the prisoner of the Republic.”
The four surrounded him, where he stood with his wife and child
clinging to him.
“Tell me how and why am I again a prisoner?”
“It is enough that you return straight to the Conciergerie, and will
know to-morrow. You are summoned for to-morrow.”
Doctor Manette, whom this visitation had so turned into stone, that
be stood with the lamp in his hand, as if be woe a statue made to hold
it, moved after these words were spoken, put the lamp down, and confronting the speaker, and taking him, not ungently, by the loose front of
his red woollen shirt, said:
“You know him, you have said. Do you know me?”
“Yes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.”
“We all know you, Citizen Doctor,” said the other three.
He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower
voice, after a pause:
“Will you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?”
“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, reluctantly, “he has been denounced
to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,” pointing out the second
who had entered, “is from Saint Antoine.”
The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added:
“He is accused by Saint Antoine.”
“Of what?” asked the Doctor.
“Citizen Doctor,” said the first, with his former reluctance, “ask no
more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you
as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before
all. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.”
“One word,” the Doctor entreated. “Will you tell me who denounced him?”
“It is against rule,” answered the first; “but you can ask Him of
Saint Antoine here.”
The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on
his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said:
“Well! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced—and gravely—
by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.”
“What other?”
“Do you ask, Citizen Doctor?”
256
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes.”
“Then,” said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, “you will be
answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!”
Chapter 8
A Hand at Cards
Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded
her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge
of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable
purchases she had to make. Mr. Cruncher, with the basket, walked at
her side. They both looked to the right and to the left into most of
the shops they passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of
people, and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group
of talkers. It was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to the eye
with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the
barges were stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the
Army of the Republic. Woe to the man who played tricks with that
Army, or got undeserved promotion in it! Better for him that his beard
had never grown, for the National Razor shaved him close.
Having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of
oil for the lamp, Miss Pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
After peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, not far from the National Palace,
once (and twice) the Tuileries, where the aspect of things rather took her
fancy. It had a quieter look than any other place of the same description
they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was not so red as
the rest. Sounding Mr. Cruncher, and finding him of her opinion, Miss
Pross resorted to the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, attended by
her cavalier.
Slightly observant of the smoky lights; of the people, pipe in mouth,
playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes; of the one bare-breasted,
bare-armed, soot-begrimed workman reading a journal aloud, and of
the others listening to him; of the weapons worn, or laid aside to be
resumed; of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep, who in
the popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, in that atti257
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
tude, like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached the counter, and showed what they wanted.
As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man
in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No
sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her hands.
In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody
was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was
the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but
only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man
with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican;
the woman, evidently English.
What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples
of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or
Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all
ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must
be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher—though it seemed on his own separate and
individual account—was in a state of the greatest wonder.
“What is the matter?” said the man who had caused Miss Pross to
scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and
in English.
“Oh, Solomon, dear Solomon!” cried Miss Pross, clapping her
hands again. “After not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for
so long a time, do I find you here!”
“Don’t call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?”
asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way.
“Brother, brother!” cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. “Have I
ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?”
“Then hold your meddlesome tongue,” said Solomon, “and come
out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out.
Who’s this man?”
Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, “Mr. Cruncher.”
“Let him come out too,” said Solomon. “Does he think me a
ghost?”
Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not
a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
258
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so,
Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language,
which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits.
“Now,” said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, “what do
you want?”
“How dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my
love away from!” cried Miss Pross, “to give me such a greeting, and
show me no affection.”
“There. Confound it! There,” said Solomon, making a dab at Miss
Pross’s lips with his own. “Now are you content?”
Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence.
“If you expect me to be surprised,” said her brother Solomon, “I am
not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are
here. If you really don’t want to endanger my existence—which I half
believe you do—go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine.
I am busy. I am an official.”
“My English brother Solomon,” mourned Miss Pross, casting up her
tear-fraught eyes, “that had the makings in him of one of the best and
greatest of men in his native country, an official among foreigners, and
such foreigners! I would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in
his—”
“I said so!” cried her brother, interrupting. “I knew it. You want
to be the death of me. I shall be rendered Suspected, by my own sister.
Just as I am getting on!”
“The gracious and merciful Heavens forbid!” cried Miss Pross. “Far
rather would I never see you again, dear Solomon, though I have ever
loved you truly, and ever shall. Say but one affectionate word to me,
and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and I will
detain you no longer.”
Good Miss Pross! As if the estrangement between them had come
of any culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact,
years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had
spent her money and left her!
He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more
grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if
their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on
the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following
259
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
singular question:
“I say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John
Solomon, or Solomon John?”
The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not
previously uttered a word.
“Come!” said Mr. Cruncher. “Speak out, you know.” (Which,
by the way, was more than he could do himself.) “John Solomon, or
Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your
sister. And I know you’re John, you know. Which of the two goes first?
And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn’t your name
over the water.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, I don’t know all I mean, for I can’t call to mind what your
name was, over the water.”
“No?”
“No. But I’ll swear it was a name of two syllables.”
“Indeed?”
“Yes. T’other one’s was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy—
witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own
father to yourself, was you called at that time?”
“Barsad,” said another voice, striking in.
“That’s the name for a thousand pound!” cried Jerry.
The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands
behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr.
Cruncher’s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey
itself.
“Don’t be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry’s,
to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present
myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present
myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother. I wish you had a better
employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was
not a Sheep of the Prisons.”
Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The
spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared—
“I’ll tell you,” said Sydney. “I lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming
out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the
walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I
remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection,
and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you
260
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your
direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near
you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation,
and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature
of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to
shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.”
“What purpose?” the spy asked.
“It would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in
the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of
your company—at the office of Tellson’s Bank, for instance?”
“Under a threat?”
“Oh! Did I say that?”
“Then, why should I go there?”
“Really, Mr. Barsad, I can’t say, if you can’t.”
“Do you mean that you won’t say, sir?” the spy irresolutely asked.
“You apprehend me very clearly, Mr. Barsad. I won’t.”
Carton’s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of
his quickness and skill, in such a business as he had in his secret mind,
and with such a man as he had to do with. His practised eye saw it, and
made the most of it.
“Now, I told you so,” said the spy, casting a reproachful look at his
sister; “if any trouble comes of this, it’s your doing.”
“Come, come, Mr. Barsad!” exclaimed Sydney. “Don’t be ungrateful. But for my great respect for your sister, I might not have led up
so pleasantly to a little proposal that I wish to make for our mutual
satisfaction. Do you go with me to the Bank?”
“I’ll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I’ll go with you.”
“I propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of
her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good
city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort
knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry’s with us. Are we
ready? Come then!”
Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney’s arm and looked
up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a
braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which
not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man.
She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so
little deserved her affection, and with Sydney’s friendly reassurances, ad261
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
equately to heed what she observed.
They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to
Mr. Lorry’s, which was within a few minutes’ walk. John Barsad, or
Solomon Pross, walked at his side.
Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery
little log or two of fire—perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture
of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson’s, who had looked into
the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago.
He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which
he saw a stranger.
“Miss Pross’s brother, sir,” said Sydney. “Mr. Barsad.”
“Barsad?” repeated the old gentleman, “Barsad? I have an association with the name—and with the face.”
“I told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,” observed Carton, coolly. “Pray sit down.”
As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry
wanted, by saying to him with a frown, “Witness at that trial.” Mr.
Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an
undisguised look of abhorrence.
“Mr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate
brother you have heard of,” said Sydney, “and has acknowledged the
relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.”
Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, “What do
you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am
about to return to him!”
“Arrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?”
“Just now, if at all.”
“Mr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,” said Sydney, “and I
have it from Mr. Barsad’s communication to a friend and brother Sheep
over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no
earthly doubt that he is retaken.”
Mr. Lorry’s business eye read in the speaker’s face that it was loss
of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something
might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was
silently attentive.
“Now, I trust,” said Sydney to him, “that the name and influence of
Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow—you said
he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?—”
262
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes; I believe so.”
“—In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I
own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette’s not having
had the power to prevent this arrest.”
“He may not have known of it beforehand,” said Mr. Lorry.
“But that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember
how identified he is with his son-in-law.”
“That’s true,” Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at
his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton.
“In short,” said Sydney, “this is a desperate time, when desperate
games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning
game; I will play the losing one. No man’s life here is worth purchase.
Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is
a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win,
is Mr. Barsad.”
“You need have good cards, sir,” said the spy.
“I’ll run them over. I’ll see what I hold,—Mr. Lorry, you know what
a brute I am; I wish you’d give me a little brandy.”
It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful—drank off another glassful—pushed the bottle thoughtfully away.
“Mr. Barsad,” he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: “Sheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican
committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer,
so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is
less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That’s
a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican
French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent
card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad,
still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt,
the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English
traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to
find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr.
Barsad?”
“Not to understand your play,” returned the spy, somewhat uneasily.
“I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section
263
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have.
Don’t hurry.”
He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and
drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into
a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured
out and drank another glassful.
“Look over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.”
It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing
cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard
swearing there—not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern
date—he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service
in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the
natives. He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a
spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge’s wine-shop; had received from the
watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette’s
imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on
Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally. He always
remembered with fear and trembling, that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her, and had looked ominously at him as her
fingers moved. He had since seen her, in the Section of Saint Antoine,
over and over again produce her knitted registers, and denounce people
whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up. He knew, as every
one employed as he was did, that he was never safe; that flight was impossible; that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe; and that
in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the
reigning terror, a word might bring it down upon him. Once denounced,
and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind,
he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he
had seen many proofs, would produce against him that fatal register,
and would quash his last chance of life. Besides that all secret men are
men soon terrified, here were surely cards enough of one black suit, to
justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over.
“You scarcely seem to like your hand,” said Sydney, with the greatest
composure. “Do you play?”
“I think, sir,” said the spy, in the meanest manner, as he turned to
264
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Mr. Lorry, “I may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence,
to put it to this other gentleman, so much your junior, whether he can
under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that Ace of
which he has spoken. I admit that I am a spy, and that it is considered
a discreditable station—though it must be filled by somebody; but this
gentleman is no spy, and why should he so demean himself as to make
himself one?”
“I play my Ace, Mr. Barsad,” said Carton, taking the answer on
himself, and looking at his watch, “without any scruple, in a very few
minutes.”
“I should have hoped, gentlemen both,” said the spy, always striving
to hook Mr. Lorry into the discussion, “that your respect for my sister—
”
“I could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally
relieving her of her brother,” said Sydney Carton.
“You think not, sir?”
“I have thoroughly made up my mind about it.”
The smooth manner of the spy, curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress, and probably with his usual demeanour, received such a check from the inscrutability of Carton,—who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he,—that it faltered here and failed
him. While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of
contemplating cards:
“And indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that
I have another good card here, not yet enumerated. That friend and
fellow-Sheep, who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons;
who was he?”
“French. You don’t know him,” said the spy, quickly.
“French, eh?” repeated Carton, musing, and not appearing to notice
him at all, though he echoed his word. “Well; he may be.”
“Is, I assure you,” said the spy; “though it’s not important.”
“Though it’s not important,” repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way—“though it’s not important—No, it’s not important. No. Yet
I know the face.”
“I think not. I am sure not. It can’t be,” said the spy.
“It-can’t-be,” muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling
his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. “Can’t-be. Spoke
good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?”
“Provincial,” said the spy.
265
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“No. Foreign!” cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table,
as a light broke clearly on his mind. “Cly! Disguised, but the same man.
We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.”
“Now, there you are hasty, sir,” said Barsad, with a smile that gave
his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; “there you really give
me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this
distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I
attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church
of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard
multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I
helped to lay him in his coffin.”
Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered
it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the
risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher’s head.
“Let us be reasonable,” said the spy, “and let us be fair. To show
you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours
is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly’s burial, which I happened to
have carried in my pocket-book,” with a hurried hand he produced and
opened it, “ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may
take it in your hand; it’s no forgery.”
Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and
Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been
more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow
with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built.
Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him
on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff.
“That there Roger Cly, master,” said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn
and iron-bound visage. “So you put him in his coffin?”
“I did.”
“Who took him out of it?”
Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, “What do you
mean?”
“I mean,” said Mr. Cruncher, “that he warn’t never in it. No! Not
he! I’ll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.”
The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in
unspeakable astonishment at Jerry.
“I tell you,” said Jerry, “that you buried paving-stones and earth in
that there coffin. Don’t go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take
266
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
in. Me and two more knows it.”
“How do you know it?”
“What’s that to you? Ecod!” growled Mr. Cruncher, “it’s you I
have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon
tradesmen! I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.”
Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at
this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and
explain himself.
“At another time, sir,” he returned, evasively, “the present time is
ill-conwenient for explainin’. What I stand to, is, that he knows well
wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was,
in so much as a word of one syllable, and I’ll either catch hold of his
throat and choke him for half a guinea;” Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this
as quite a liberal offer; “or I’ll out and announce him.”
“Humph! I see one thing,” said Carton. “I hold another card, Mr.
Barsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air,
for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with
another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to
life again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic.
A strong card—a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?”
“No!” returned the spy. “I throw up. I confess that we were so
unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England
at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up
and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham.
Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to
me.”
“Never you trouble your head about this man,” retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; “you’ll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. And look here! Once more!”—Mr. Cruncher
could not be restrained from making rather an ostentatious parade of
his liberality—“I’d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a
guinea.”
The Sheep of the prisons turned from him to Sydney Carton, and
said, with more decision, “It has come to a point. I go on duty soon,
and can’t overstay my time. You told me you had a proposal; what is
it? Now, it is of no use asking too much of me. Ask me to do anything
in my office, putting my head in great extra danger, and I had better
267
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
trust my life to the chances of a refusal than the chances of consent. In
short, I should make that choice. You talk of desperation. We are all
desperate here. Remember! I may denounce you if I think proper, and I
can swear my way through stone walls, and so can others. Now, what
do you want with me?”
“Not very much. You are a turnkey at the Conciergerie?”
“I tell you once for all, there is no such thing as an escape possible,”
said the spy, firmly.
“Why need you tell me what I have not asked? You are a turnkey at
the Conciergerie?”
“I am sometimes.”
“You can be when you choose?”
“I can pass in and out when I choose.”
Sydney Carton filled another glass with brandy, poured it slowly out
upon the hearth, and watched it as it dropped. It being all spent, he said,
rising:
“So far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well
that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me.
Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.”
Chapter 9
The Game Made
While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr.
Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest
tradesman’s manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he
changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those
limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a
very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry’s eye
caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to
be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character.
“Jerry,” said Mr. Lorry. “Come here.”
Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in
advance of him.
“What have you been, besides a messenger?”
268
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, “Agicultooral character.”
“My mind misgives me much,” said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a
forefinger at him, “that you have used the respectable and great house
of Tellson’s as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of
an infamous description. If you have, don’t expect me to befriend you
when you get back to England. If you have, don’t expect me to keep
your secret. Tellson’s shall not be imposed upon.”
“I hope, sir,” pleaded the abashed Mr. Cruncher, “that a gentleman
like yourself wot I’ve had the honour of odd jobbing till I’m grey at it,
would think twice about harming of me, even if it wos so—I don’t say
it is, but even if it wos. And which it is to be took into account that if
it wos, it wouldn’t, even then, be all o’ one side. There’d be two sides
to it. There might be medical doctors at the present hour, a picking
up their guineas where a honest tradesman don’t pick up his fardens—
fardens! no, nor yet his half fardens—half fardens! no, nor yet his
quarter—a banking away like smoke at Tellson’s, and a cocking their
medical eyes at that tradesman on the sly, a going in and going out to
their own carriages—ah! equally like smoke, if not more so. Well, that
’ud be imposing, too, on Tellson’s. For you cannot sarse the goose and
not the gander. And here’s Mrs. Cruncher, or leastways wos in the Old
England times, and would be to-morrow, if cause given, a floppin’ again
the business to that degree as is ruinating—stark ruinating! Whereas
them medical doctors’ wives don’t flop—catch ’em at it! Or, if they flop,
their toppings goes in favour of more patients, and how can you rightly
have one without t’other? Then, wot with undertakers, and wot with
parish clerks, and wot with sextons, and wot with private watchmen
(all awaricious and all in it), a man wouldn’t get much by it, even if it
wos so. And wot little a man did get, would never prosper with him,
Mr. Lorry. He’d never have no good of it; he’d want all along to be out
of the line, if he, could see his way out, being once in—even if it wos
so.”
“Ugh!” cried Mr. Lorry, rather relenting, nevertheless, “I am
shocked at the sight of you.”
“Now, what I would humbly offer to you, sir,” pursued Mr.
Cruncher, “even if it wos so, which I don’t say it is—”
“Don’t prevaricate,” said Mr. Lorry.
“No, I will not, sir,” returned Mr. Crunches as if nothing were fur269
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
ther from his thoughts or practice—“which I don’t say it is—wot I
would humbly offer to you, sir, would be this. Upon that there stool,
at that there Bar, sets that there boy of mine, brought up and growed
up to be a man, wot will errand you, message you, general-light-job
you, till your heels is where your head is, if such should be your wishes.
If it wos so, which I still don’t say it is (for I will not prewaricate to
you, sir), let that there boy keep his father’s place, and take care of his
mother; don’t blow upon that boy’s father—do not do it, sir—and let
that father go into the line of the reg’lar diggin’, and make amends for
what he would have undug—if it wos so-by diggin’ of ’em in with a will,
and with conwictions respectin’ the futur’ keepin’ of ’em safe. That, Mr.
Lorry,” said Mr. Cruncher, wiping his forehead with his arm, as an announcement that he had arrived at the peroration of his discourse, “is
wot I would respectfully offer to you, sir. A man don’t see all this here
a goin’ on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads,
dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and
hardly that, without havin’ his serious thoughts of things. And these
here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin’ of you fur to bear in mind
that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might
have kep’ it back.”
“That at least is true,” said Mr. Lorry. “Say no more now. It may
be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in
action—not in words. I want no more words.”
Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy
returned from the dark room. “Adieu, Mr. Barsad,” said the former;
“our arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.”
He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When
they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done?
“Not much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured
access to him, once.”
Mr. Lorry’s countenance fell.
“It is all I could do,” said Carton. “To propose too much, would be
to put this man’s head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing
worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the
weakness of the position. There is no help for it.”
“But access to him,” said Mr. Lorry, “if it should go ill before the
Tribunal, will not save him.”
“I never said it would.”
Mr. Lorry’s eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his
270
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually
weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of
late, and his tears fell.
“You are a good man and a true friend,” said Carton, in an altered
voice. “Forgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see
my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune,
however.”
Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner,
there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch,
that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly
unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it.
“To return to poor Darnay,” said Carton. “Don’t tell Her of this
interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see
him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey
to him the means of anticipating the sentence.”
Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton
to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and
evidently understood it.
“She might think a thousand things,” Carton said, “and any of them
would only add to her trouble. Don’t speak of me to her. As I said to
you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to
do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without
that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.”
“I am going now, directly.”
“I am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and
reliance on you. How does she look?”
“Anxious and unhappy, but very beautiful.”
“Ah!”
It was a long, grieving sound, like a sigh—almost like a sob. It
attracted Mr. Lorry’s eyes to Carton’s face, which was turned to the
fire. A light, or a shade (the old gentleman could not have said which),
passed from it as swiftly as a change will sweep over a hill-side on a
wild bright day, and he lifted his foot to put back one of the little flaming logs, which was tumbling forward. He wore the white riding-coat
and top-boots, then in vogue, and the light of the fire touching their
light surfaces made him look very pale, with his long brown hair, all
untrimmed, hanging loose about him. His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry;
271
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had
broken under the weight of his foot.
“I forgot it,” he said.
Mr. Lorry’s eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the
wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having
the expression of prisoners’ faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly
reminded of that expression.
“And your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?” said Carton,
turning to him.
“Yes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to have left
them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave
to Pass. I was ready to go.”
They were both silent.
“Yours is a long life to look back upon, sir?” said Carton, wistfully.
“I am in my seventy-eighth year.”
“You have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied;
trusted, respected, and looked up to?”
“I have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. indeed,
I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.”
“See what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will
miss you when you leave it empty!”
“A solitary old bachelor,” answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head.
“There is nobody to weep for me.”
“How can you say that? Wouldn’t She weep for you? Wouldn’t her
child?”
“Yes, yes, thank God. I didn’t quite mean what I said.”
“It is a thing to thank God for; is it not?”
“Surely, surely.”
“If you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, ’I
have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect,
of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard;
I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!’ your
seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they
not?”
“You say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.”
Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a
few moments, said:
“I should like to ask you:—Does your childhood seem far off? Do
272
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the days when you sat at your mother’s knee, seem days of very long
ago?”
Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered:
“Twenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no. For, as I draw
closer and closer to the end, I travel in the circle, nearer and nearer to
the beginning. It seems to be one of the kind smoothings and preparings
of the way. My heart is touched now, by many remembrances that had
long fallen asleep, of my pretty young mother (and I so old!), and by
many associations of the days when what we call the World was not so
real with me, and my faults were not confirmed in me.”
“I understand the feeling!” exclaimed Carton, with a bright flush.
“And you are the better for it?”
“I hope so.”
Carton terminated the conversation here, by rising to help him on
with his outer coat; “But you,” said Mr. Lorry, reverting to the theme,
“you are young.”
“Yes,” said Carton. “I am not old, but my young way was never the
way to age. Enough of me.”
“And of me, I am sure,” said Mr. Lorry. “Are you going out?”
“I’ll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless
habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don’t be uneasy;
I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?”
“Yes, unhappily.”
“I shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a
place for me. Take my arm, sir.”
Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets.
A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry’s destination. Carton left
him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate
again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to
the prison every day. “She came out here,” he said, looking about him,
“turned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in
her steps.”
It was ten o’clock at night when he stood before the prison of La
Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer,
having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door.
“Good night, citizen,” said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for,
the man eyed him inquisitively.
“Good night, citizen.”
“How goes the Republic?”
273
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“You mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall
mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes,
of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a
Barber!”
“Do you often go to see him—”
“Shave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at
work?”
“Never.”
“Go and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself,
citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less
than two pipes. Word of honour!”
As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to
explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising
desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away.
“But you are not English,” said the wood-sawyer, “though you wear
English dress?”
“Yes,” said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder.
“You speak like a Frenchman.”
“I am an old student here.”
“Aha, a perfect Frenchman! Good night, Englishman.”
“Good night, citizen.”
“But go and see that droll dog,” the little man persisted, calling after
him. “And take a pipe with you!”
Sydney had not gone far out of sight, when he stopped in the middle
of the street under a glimmering lamp, and wrote with his pencil on
a scrap of paper. Then, traversing with the decided step of one who
remembered the way well, several dark and dirty streets—much dirtier
than usual, for the best public thoroughfares remained uncleansed in
those times of terror—he stopped at a chemist’s shop, which the owner
was closing with his own hands. A small, dim, crooked shop, kept in a
tortuous, up-hill thoroughfare, by a small, dim, crooked man.
Giving this citizen, too, good night, as he confronted him at his
counter, he laid the scrap of paper before him. “Whew!” the chemist
whistled softly, as he read it. “Hi! hi! hi!”
Sydney Carton took no heed, and the chemist said:
“For you, citizen?”
“For me.”
“You will be careful to keep them separate, citizen? You know the
consequences of mixing them?”
274
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Perfectly.”
Certain small packets were made and given to him. He put them,
one by one, in the breast of his inner coat, counted out the money for
them, and deliberately left the shop. “There is nothing more to do,”
said he, glancing upward at the moon, “until to-morrow. I can’t sleep.”
It was not a reckless manner, the manner in which he said these
words aloud under the fast-sailing clouds, nor was it more expressive of
negligence than defiance. It was the settled manner of a tired man, who
had wandered and struggled and got lost, but who at length struck into
his road and saw its end.
Long ago, when he had been famous among his earliest competitors
as a youth of great promise, he had followed his father to the grave.
His mother had died, years before. These solemn words, which had
been read at his father’s grave, arose in his mind as he went down the
dark streets, among the heavy shadows, with the moon and the clouds
sailing on high above him. “I am the resurrection and the life, saith the
Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
and whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall never die.”
In a city dominated by the axe, alone at night, with natural sorrow
rising in him for the sixty-three who had been that day put to death,
and for to-morrow’s victims then awaiting their doom in the prisons,
and still of to-morrow’s and to-morrow’s, the chain of association that
brought the words home, like a rusty old ship’s anchor from the deep,
might have been easily found. He did not seek it, but repeated them and
went on.
With a solemn interest in the lighted windows where the people were
going to rest, forgetful through a few calm hours of the horrors surrounding them; in the towers of the churches, where no prayers were
said, for the popular revulsion had even travelled that length of selfdestruction from years of priestly impostors, plunderers, and profligates;
in the distant burial-places, reserved, as they wrote upon the gates, for
Eternal Sleep; in the abounding gaols; and in the streets along which
the sixties rolled to a death which had become so common and material,
that no sorrowful story of a haunting Spirit ever arose among the people
out of all the working of the Guillotine; with a solemn interest in the
whole life and death of the city settling down to its short nightly pause
in fury; Sydney Carton crossed the Seine again for the lighter streets.
Few coaches were abroad, for riders in coaches were liable to be
suspected, and gentility hid its head in red nightcaps, and put on heavy
275
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
shoes, and trudged. But, the theatres were all well filled, and the people
poured cheerfully out as he passed, and went chatting home. At one of
the theatre doors, there was a little girl with a mother, looking for a way
across the street through the mud. He carried the child over, and before,
the timid arm was loosed from his neck asked her for a kiss.
“I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me, shall never die.”
Now, that the streets were quiet, and the night wore on, the words
were in the echoes of his feet, and were in the air. Perfectly calm and
steady, he sometimes repeated them to himself as he walked; but, he
heard them always.
The night wore out, and, as he stood upon the bridge listening to
the water as it splashed the river-walls of the Island of Paris, where the
picturesque confusion of houses and cathedral shone bright in the light
of the moon, the day came coldly, looking like a dead face out of the sky.
Then, the night, with the moon and the stars, turned pale and died, and
for a little while it seemed as if Creation were delivered over to Death’s
dominion.
But, the glorious sun, rising, seemed to strike those words, that
burden of the night, straight and warm to his heart in its long bright
rays. And looking along them, with reverently shaded eyes, a bridge of
light appeared to span the air between him and the sun, while the river
sparkled under it.
The strong tide, so swift, so deep, and certain, was like a congenial
friend, in the morning stillness. He walked by the stream, far from the
houses, and in the light and warmth of the sun fell asleep on the bank.
When he awoke and was afoot again, he lingered there yet a little longer,
watching an eddy that turned and turned purposeless, until the stream
absorbed it, and carried it on to the sea.—“Like me.”
A trading-boat, with a sail of the softened colour of a dead leaf, then
glided into his view, floated by him, and died away. As its silent track in
the water disappeared, the prayer that had broken up out of his heart
for a merciful consideration of all his poor blindnesses and errors, ended
in the words, “I am the resurrection and the life.”
Mr. Lorry was already out when he got back, and it was easy to surmise where the good old man was gone. Sydney Carton drank nothing
but a little coffee, ate some bread, and, having washed and changed to
refresh himself, went out to the place of trial.
276
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
The court was all astir and a-buzz, when the black sheep—whom
many fell away from in dread—pressed him into an obscure corner
among the crowd. Mr. Lorry was there, and Doctor Manette was there.
She was there, sitting beside her father.
When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so
sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into
his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been
any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would
have been seen to be the same influence exactly.
Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure,
ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could
have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had
not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the
Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds.
Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots
and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow
and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a
craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose
appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting,
cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.
Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor.
No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising,
murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other
eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at
one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.
Charles Evremonde, called Darnay. Released yesterday. Reaccused
and retaken yesterday. Indictment delivered to him last night. Suspected
and Denounced enemy of the Republic, Aristocrat, one of a family of
tyrants, one of a race proscribed, for that they had used their abolished
privileges to the infamous oppression of the people. Charles Evremonde,
called Darnay, in right of such proscription, absolutely Dead in Law.
To this effect, in as few or fewer words, the Public Prosecutor.
The President asked, was the Accused openly denounced or secretly?
“Openly, President.”
“By whom?”
“Three voices. Ernest Defarge, wine-vendor of St. Antoine.”
“Good.”
277
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Therese Defarge, his wife.”
“Good.”
“Alexandre Manette, physician.”
A great uproar took place in the court, and in the midst of it, Doctor Manette was seen, pale and trembling, standing where he had been
seated.
“President, I indignantly protest to you that this is a forgery and a
fraud. You know the accused to be the husband of my daughter. My
daughter, and those dear to her, are far dearer to me than my life. Who
and where is the false conspirator who says that I denounce the husband
of my child!”
“Citizen Manette, be tranquil. To fail in submission to the authority
of the Tribunal would be to put yourself out of Law. As to what is
dearer to you than life, nothing can be so dear to a good citizen as the
Republic.”
Loud acclamations hailed this rebuke. The President rang his bell,
and with warmth resumed.
“If the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child
herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is
to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!”
Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down,
with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew
closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together,
and restored the usual hand to his mouth.
Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of
his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment,
and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor’s service, and of the
release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to
him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its
work.
“You did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?”
“I believe so.”
Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: “You were one
of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannoneer that
day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress
when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!”
It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the
audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but,
The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, “I defy that
278
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
bell!” wherein she was likewise much commended.
“Inform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille,
citizen.”
“I knew,” said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the
bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him;
“I knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell
known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself.
He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North
Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day,
I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount
to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a
gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone
has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that
written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of
the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette.
I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of
the President.”
“Let it be read.”
In a dead silence and stillness—the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader,
Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon
the Doctor, who saw none of them—the paper was read, as follows.
Chapter 10
The Substance of the Shadow
“I, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and
afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful
cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at
stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall
of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of
concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my
sorrows are dust.
“These words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I
write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney,
279
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity.
Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings
I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired,
but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right
mind—that my memory is exact and circumstantial—and that I write
the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether
they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat.
“One cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I
think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of
the frosty air, at an hour’s distance from my place of residence in the
Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind
me, driven very fast. As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the
window, and a voice called to the driver to stop.
“The carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses,
and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage
was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open
the door and alight before I came up with it.
I observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to
conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door,
I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather
younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and
(as far as I could see) face too.
“ ‘You are Doctor Manette?’ said one.
“I am.”
“ ‘Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,’ said the other; ‘the young
physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two
has made a rising reputation in Paris?’
“ ‘Gentlemen,’ I returned, ‘I am that Doctor Manette of whom you
speak so graciously.’
“ ‘We have been to your residence,’ said the first, ‘and not being so
fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking
you. Will you please to enter the carriage?’
“The manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these
words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. They were armed. I was not.
“ ‘Gentlemen,’ said I, ‘pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me
280
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to
which I am summoned.’
“The reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. ’Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case,
our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the
carriage?’
“I could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They
both entered after me—the last springing in, after putting up the steps.
The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed.
“I repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt
that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it
took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where
I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and
put my paper in its hiding-place.
* * * *
“The carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and
emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the
Barrier—I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards
when I traversed it—it struck out of the main avenue, and presently
stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a
damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house. It was not opened immediately, in
answer to the ringing of the bell, and one of my two conductors struck
the man who opened it, with his heavy riding glove, across the face.
“There was nothing in this action to attract my particular attention,
for I had seen common people struck more commonly than dogs. But,
the other of the two, being angry likewise, struck the man in like manner
with his arm; the look and bearing of the brothers were then so exactly
alike, that I then first perceived them to be twin brothers.
“From the time of our alighting at the outer gate (which we found
locked, and which one of the brothers had opened to admit us, and
had relocked), I had heard cries proceeding from an upper chamber. I
was conducted to this chamber straight, the cries growing louder as we
ascended the stairs, and I found a patient in a high fever of the brain,
lying on a bed.
“The patient was a woman of great beauty, and young; assuredly
not much past twenty. Her hair was torn and ragged, and her arms
were bound to her sides with sashes and handkerchiefs. I noticed that
281
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
these bonds were all portions of a gentleman’s dress. On one of them,
which was a fringed scarf for a dress of ceremony, I saw the armorial
bearings of a Noble, and the letter E.
“I saw this, within the first minute of my contemplation of the patient; for, in her restless strivings she had turned over on her face on the
edge of the bed, had drawn the end of the scarf into her mouth, and
was in danger of suffocation. My first act was to put out my hand to
relieve her breathing; and in moving the scarf aside, the embroidery in
the corner caught my sight.
“I turned her gently over, placed my hands upon her breast to calm
her and keep her down, and looked into her face. Her eyes were dilated
and wild, and she constantly uttered piercing shrieks, and repeated the
words, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ and then counted up
to twelve, and said, ‘Hush!’ For an instant, and no more, she would
pause to listen, and then the piercing shrieks would begin again, and
she would repeat the cry, ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’
and would count up to twelve, and say, ‘Hush!’ There was no variation
in the order, or the manner. There was no cessation, but the regular
moment’s pause, in the utterance of these sounds.
“ ‘How long,’ I asked, ‘has this lasted?’
“To distinguish the brothers, I will call them the elder and the
younger; by the elder, I mean him who exercised the most authority.
It was the elder who replied, ‘Since about this hour last night.’
“ ‘She has a husband, a father, and a brother?’
“ ‘A brother.’
“ ‘I do not address her brother?’
“He answered with great contempt, ‘No.’
“ ‘She has some recent association with the number twelve?’
“The younger brother impatiently rejoined, ‘With twelve o’clock?’
“ ‘See, gentlemen,’ said I, still keeping my hands upon her breast,
’how useless I am, as you have brought me! If I had known what I was
coming to see, I could have come provided. As it is, time must be lost.
There are no medicines to be obtained in this lonely place.’
“The elder brother looked to the younger, who said haughtily, ‘There
is a case of medicines here;’ and brought it from a closet, and put it on
the table.
* * * *
“I opened some of the bottles, smelt them, and put the stoppers to
my lips. If I had wanted to use anything save narcotic medicines that
282
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
were poisons in themselves, I would not have administered any of those.
“ ‘Do you doubt them?’ asked the younger brother.
“ ‘You see, monsieur, I am going to use them,’ I replied, and said no
more.
“I made the patient swallow, with great difficulty, and after many
efforts, the dose that I desired to give. As I intended to repeat it after a
while, and as it was necessary to watch its influence, I then sat down by
the side of the bed. There was a timid and suppressed woman in attendance (wife of the man down-stairs), who had retreated into a corner.
The house was damp and decayed, indifferently furnished—evidently,
recently occupied and temporarily used. Some thick old hangings had
been nailed up before the windows, to deaden the sound of the shrieks.
They continued to be uttered in their regular succession, with the cry,
‘My husband, my father, and my brother!’ the counting up to twelve,
and ‘Hush!’ The frenzy was so violent, that I had not unfastened the
bandages restraining the arms; but, I had looked to them, to see that
they were not painful. The only spark of encouragement in the case,
was, that my hand upon the sufferer’s breast had this much soothing
influence, that for minutes at a time it tranquillised the figure. It had no
effect upon the cries; no pendulum could be more regular.
“For the reason that my hand had this effect (I assume), I had sat by
the side of the bed for half an hour, with the two brothers looking on,
before the elder said:
“ ‘There is another patient.’
“I was startled, and asked, ‘Is it a pressing case?’
“ ‘You had better see,’ he carelessly answered; and took up a light.
* * * *
“The other patient lay in a back room across a second staircase,
which was a species of loft over a stable. There was a low plastered
ceiling to a part of it; the rest was open, to the ridge of the tiled roof,
and there were beams across. Hay and straw were stored in that portion
of the place, fagots for firing, and a heap of apples in sand. I had to pass
through that part, to get at the other. My memory is circumstantial and
unshaken. I try it with these details, and I see them all, in this my cell
in the Bastille, near the close of the tenth year of my captivity, as I saw
them all that night.
“On some hay on the ground, with a cushion thrown under his head,
lay a handsome peasant boy—a boy of not more than seventeen at the
most. He lay on his back, with his teeth set, his right hand clenched on
283
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
his breast, and his glaring eyes looking straight upward. I could not see
where his wound was, as I kneeled on one knee over him; but, I could
see that he was dying of a wound from a sharp point.
“ ‘I am a doctor, my poor fellow,’ said I. ‘Let me examine it.’
“ ‘I do not want it examined,’ he answered; ‘let it be.’
“It was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand
away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twentyfour hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been
looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to
the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose
life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit;
not at all as if he were a fellow-creature.
“ ‘How has this been done, monsieur?’ said I.
“ ‘A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw
upon him, and has fallen by my brother’s sword—like a gentleman.’
“There was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this
answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to
have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have
been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin
kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the
boy, or about his fate.
“The boy’s eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and
they now slowly moved to me.
“ ‘Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs
are proud too, sometimes. They plunder us, outrage us, beat us, kill
us; but we have a little pride left, sometimes. She—have you seen her,
Doctor?’
“The shrieks and the cries were audible there, though subdued by
the distance. He referred to them, as if she were lying in our presence.
“I said, ‘I have seen her.’
“ ‘She is my sister, Doctor. They have had their shameful rights, these
Nobles, in the modesty and virtue of our sisters, many years, but we
have had good girls among us. I know it, and have heard my father say
so. She was a good girl. She was betrothed to a good young man, too:
a tenant of his. We were all tenants of his—that man’s who stands there.
The other is his brother, the worst of a bad race.’
“It was with the greatest difficulty that the boy gathered bodily force
to speak; but, his spirit spoke with a dreadful emphasis.
“ ‘We were so robbed by that man who stands there, as all we com284
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
mon dogs are by those superior Beings—taxed by him without mercy,
obliged to work for him without pay, obliged to grind our corn at his
mill, obliged to feed scores of his tame birds on our wretched crops, and
forbidden for our lives to keep a single tame bird of our own, pillaged
and plundered to that degree that when we chanced to have a bit of
meat, we ate it in fear, with the door barred and the shutters closed,
that his people should not see it and take it from us—I say, we were so
robbed, and hunted, and were made so poor, that our father told us it
was a dreadful thing to bring a child into the world, and that what we
should most pray for, was, that our women might be barren and our
miserable race die out!’
“I had never before seen the sense of being oppressed, bursting forth
like a fire. I had supposed that it must be latent in the people somewhere;
but, I had never seen it break out, until I saw it in the dying boy.
“ ‘Nevertheless, Doctor, my sister married. He was ailing at that
time, poor fellow, and she married her lover, that she might tend and
comfort him in our cottage—our dog-hut, as that man would call it.
She had not been married many weeks, when that man’s brother saw
her and admired her, and asked that man to lend her to him—for what
are husbands among us! He was willing enough, but my sister was good
and virtuous, and hated his brother with a hatred as strong as mine.
What did the two then, to persuade her husband to use his influence
with her, to make her willing?’
“The boy’s eyes, which had been fixed on mine, slowly turned to
the looker-on, and I saw in the two faces that all he said was true. The
two opposing kinds of pride confronting one another, I can see, even in
this Bastille; the gentleman’s, all negligent indifference; the peasants, all
trodden-down sentiment, and passionate revenge.
“ ‘You know, Doctor, that it is among the Rights of these Nobles to
harness us common dogs to carts, and drive us. They so harnessed him
and drove him. You know that it is among their Rights to keep us in
their grounds all night, quieting the frogs, in order that their noble sleep
may not be disturbed. They kept him out in the unwholesome mists at
night, and ordered him back into his harness in the day. But he was not
persuaded. No! Taken out of harness one day at noon, to feed—if he
could find food—he sobbed twelve times, once for every stroke of the
bell, and died on her bosom.’
“Nothing human could have held life in the boy but his determination to tell all his wrong. He forced back the gathering shadows of
285
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
death, as he forced his clenched right hand to remain clenched, and to
cover his wound.
“ ‘Then, with that man’s permission and even with his aid, his
brother took her away; in spite of what I know she must have told
his brother—and what that is, will not be long unknown to you, Doctor,
if it is now—his brother took her away—for his pleasure and diversion,
for a little while. I saw her pass me on the road. When I took the tidings home, our father’s heart burst; he never spoke one of the words that
filled it. I took my young sister (for I have another) to a place beyond
the reach of this man, and where, at least, she will never be his vassal.
Then, I tracked the brother here, and last night climbed in—a common
dog, but sword in hand.—Where is the loft window? It was somewhere
here?’
“The room was darkening to his sight; the world was narrowing
around him. I glanced about me, and saw that the hay and straw were
trampled over the floor, as if there had been a struggle.
“ ‘She heard me, and ran in. I told her not to come near us till he
was dead. He came in and first tossed me some pieces of money; then
struck at me with a whip. But I, though a common dog, so struck at
him as to make him draw. Let him break into as many pieces as he will,
the sword that he stained with my common blood; he drew to defend
himself—thrust at me with all his skill for his life.’
“My glance had fallen, but a few moments before, on the fragments
of a broken sword, lying among the hay. That weapon was a gentleman’s. In another place, lay an old sword that seemed to have been a
soldier’s.
“ ‘Now, lift me up, Doctor; lift me up. Where is he?’
“ ‘He is not here,’ I said, supporting the boy, and thinking that he
referred to the brother.
“ ‘He! Proud as these nobles are, he is afraid to see me. Where is the
man who was here? turn my face to him.’
“I did so, raising the boy’s head against my knee. But, invested
for the moment with extraordinary power, he raised himself completely:
obliging me to rise too, or I could not have still supported him.
“ ‘Marquis,’ said the boy, turned to him with his eyes opened wide,
and his right hand raised, ‘in the days when all these things are to be
answered for, I summon you and yours, to the last of your bad race, to
answer for them. I mark this cross of blood upon you, as a sign that I
do it. In the days when all these things are to be answered for, I summon
286
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
your brother, the worst of the bad race, to answer for them separately. I
mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.’
“Twice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his
forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the finger
yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down
dead.
* * * *
“When I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her
raving in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might
last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the
grave.
“I repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of
the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing
quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of
her words. They were always ‘My husband, my father, and my brother!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
Hush!’
“This lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I
had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began
to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and
by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead.
“It was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and
fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me
to compose her figure and the dress she had to. It was then that I knew
her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a
mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had
of her.
“ ‘Is she dead?’ asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the
elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse.
“ ‘Not dead,’ said I; ‘but like to die.’
“ ‘What strength there is in these common bodies!’ he said, looking
down at her with some curiosity.
“ ‘There is prodigious strength,’ I answered him, ‘in sorrow and despair.’
“He first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He
moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away,
and said in a subdued voice,
“ ‘Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and,
287
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful
of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and
not spoken of.’
“I listened to the patient’s breathing, and avoided answering.
“ ‘Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?’
“ ‘Monsieur,’ said I, ‘in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.’ I was guarded in my answer,
for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen.
“Her breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the
pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I
resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.
* * * *
“I write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful
of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure
in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever
spoken between me and those brothers.
“She lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some
few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She
asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her. It
was in vain that I asked her for her family name. She faintly shook her
head upon the pillow, and kept her secret, as the boy had done.
“I had no opportunity of asking her any question, until I had told the
brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then,
though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman
and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the
curtain at the head of the bed when I was there. But when it came to
that, they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her;
as if—the thought passed through my mind—I were dying too.
“I always observed that their pride bitterly resented the younger
brother’s (as I call him) having crossed swords with a peasant, and that
peasant a boy. The only consideration that appeared to affect the mind
of either of them was the consideration that this was highly degrading
to the family, and was ridiculous. As often as I caught the younger
brother’s eyes, their expression reminded me that he disliked me deeply,
for knowing what I knew from the boy. He was smoother and more
polite to me than the elder; but I saw this. I also saw that I was an
incumbrance in the mind of the elder, too.
“My patient died, two hours before midnight—at a time, by my
288
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
watch, answering almost to the minute when I had first seen her. I was
alone with her, when her forlorn young head drooped gently on one
side, and all her earthly wrongs and sorrows ended.
“The brothers were waiting in a room down-stairs, impatient to ride
away. I had heard them, alone at the bedside, striking their boots with
their riding-whips, and loitering up and down.
“ ‘At last she is dead?’ said the elder, when I went in.
“ ‘She is dead,’ said I.
“ ‘I congratulate you, my brother,’ were his words as he turned
round.
“He had before offered me money, which I had postponed taking.
He now gave me a rouleau of gold. I took it from his hand, but laid it
on the table. I had considered the question, and had resolved to accept
nothing.
“ ‘Pray excuse me,’ said I. ‘Under the circumstances, no.’
“They exchanged looks, but bent their heads to me as I bent mine
to them, and we parted without another word on either side.
* * * *
“I am weary, weary, weary-worn down by misery. I cannot read
what I have written with this gaunt hand.
“Early in the morning, the rouleau of gold was left at my door in a
little box, with my name on the outside. From the first, I had anxiously
considered what I ought to do. I decided, that day, to write privately
to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been
summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all
the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the
immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would
never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the
matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved
to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger;
but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were
compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed.
“I was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that
night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was
the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed,
when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me.
* * * *
“I am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself.
It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon
289
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
me is so dreadful.
“The lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for
long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the
wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the
boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered
on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I
had seen that nobleman very lately.
“My memory is still accurate, but I cannot write the words of our
conversation. I suspect that I am watched more closely than I was, and
I know not at what times I may be watched. She had in part suspected,
and in part discovered, the main facts of the cruel story, of her husband’s
share in it, and my being resorted to. She did not know that the girl was
dead. Her hope had been, she said in great distress, to show her, in
secret, a woman’s sympathy. Her hope had been to avert the wrath of
Heaven from a House that had long been hateful to the suffering many.
“She had reasons for believing that there was a young sister living,
and her greatest desire was, to help that sister. I could tell her nothing
but that there was such a sister; beyond that, I knew nothing. Her
inducement to come to me, relying on my confidence, had been the
hope that I could tell her the name and place of abode. Whereas, to this
wretched hour I am ignorant of both.
* * * *
“These scraps of paper fail me. One was taken from me, with a
warning, yesterday. I must finish my record to-day.
“She was a good, compassionate lady, and not happy in her marriage. How could she be! The brother distrusted and disliked her, and
his influence was all opposed to her; she stood in dread of him, and in
dread of her husband too. When I handed her down to the door, there
was a child, a pretty boy from two to three years old, in her carriage.
“ ‘For his sake, Doctor,’ she said, pointing to him in tears, ‘I would
do all I can to make what poor amends I can. He will never prosper
in his inheritance otherwise. I have a presentiment that if no other innocent atonement is made for this, it will one day be required of him.
What I have left to call my own—it is little beyond the worth of a few
jewels—I will make it the first charge of his life to bestow, with the compassion and lamenting of his dead mother, on this injured family, if the
sister can be discovered.’
“She kissed the boy, and said, caressing him, ‘It is for thine own
dear sake. Thou wilt be faithful, little Charles?’ The child answered her
290
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
bravely, ‘Yes!’ I kissed her hand, and she took him in her arms, and
went away caressing him. I never saw her more.
“As she had mentioned her husband’s name in the faith that I knew
it, I added no mention of it to my letter. I sealed my letter, and, not
trusting it out of my own hands, delivered it myself that day.
“That night, the last night of the year, towards nine o’clock, a man
in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly followed my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs. When my servant
came into the room where I sat with my wife—O my wife, beloved of
my heart! My fair young English wife!—we saw the man, who was
supposed to be at the gate, standing silent behind him.
“An urgent case in the Rue St. Honore, he said. It would not detain
me, he had a coach in waiting.
“It brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear
of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from
behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road
from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis
took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in
the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his
foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my
living grave.
“If it had pleased God to put it in the hard heart of either of the
brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife—so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead—I
might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now
I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they
have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the
last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last
night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times
when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven
and to earth.”
A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done.
A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but
blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time,
and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.
Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show
how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding
their time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long
291
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal
register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would
have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation.
And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was
a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.
One of the frenzied aspirations of the populace was, for imitations of
the questionable public virtues of antiquity, and for sacrifices and selfimmolations on the people’s altar. Therefore when the President said
(else had his own head quivered on his shoulders), that the good physician of the Republic would deserve better still of the Republic by rooting out an obnoxious family of Aristocrats, and would doubtless feel
a sacred glow and joy in making his daughter a widow and her child
an orphan, there was wild excitement, patriotic fervour, not a touch of
human sympathy.
“Much influence around him, has that Doctor?” murmured
Madame Defarge, smiling to The Vengeance. “Save him now, my Doctor, save him!”
At every juryman’s vote, there was a roar. Another and another.
Roar and roar.
Unanimously voted. At heart and by descent an Aristocrat, an enemy of the Republic, a notorious oppressor of the People. Back to the
Conciergerie, and Death within four-and-twenty hours!
Chapter 11
Dusk
The wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no
sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was
she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment
it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.
The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of
doors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the
court’s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie
stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her
face but love and consolation.
292
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens,
if you would have so much compassion for us!”
There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had
taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the
show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, “Let her embrace him
then; it is but a moment.” It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed
her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over
the dock, could fold her in his arms.
“Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love.
We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!”
They were her husband’s words, as he held her to his bosom.
“I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don’t suffer
for me. A parting blessing for our child.”
“I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by
you.”
“My husband. No! A moment!” He was tearing himself apart from
her. “We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart
by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her,
God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.”
Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to
both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:
“No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should
kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know,
now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when
you knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against,
and conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts,
and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!”
Her father’s only answer was to draw his hands through his white
hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
“It could not be otherwise,” said the prisoner. “All things have
worked together as they have fallen out. it was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother’s trust that first brought my fatal
presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end
was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive
me. Heaven bless you!”
As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking
after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer,
and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners’ door, she turned, laid her
293
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
head lovingly on her father’s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his
feet.
Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never
moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr.
Lorry were with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported
her head. Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity—that
had a flush of pride in it.
“Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.”
He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a
coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat
beside the driver.
When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark
not many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough
stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and carried
her up the staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down on a couch,
where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.
“Don’t recall her to herself,” he said, softly, to the latter, “she is
better so. Don’t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.”
“Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!” cried little Lucie, springing
up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief.
“Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help
mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can
you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?”
He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face.
He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.
“Before I go,” he said, and paused—“I may kiss her?”
It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched
her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was
nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when
she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, “A life you love.”
When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on
Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:
“You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at
least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly
to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?”
“Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.” He returned the
answer in great trouble, and very slowly.
“Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon
294
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
are few and short, but try.”
“I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.”
“That’s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things
before now—though never,” he added, with a smile and a sigh together,
“such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we
misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it
were not.”
“I will go,” said Doctor Manette, “to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I
will write too, and—But stay! There is a Celebration in the streets, and
no one will be accessible until dark.”
“That’s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much
the forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you
speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have
seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?”
“Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
this.”
“It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I
go to Mr. Lorry’s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from
our friend or from yourself?”
“Yes.”
“May you prosper!”
Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on
the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.
“I have no hope,” said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
“Nor have I.”
“If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare
him—which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man’s to
them!—I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the
court.”
“And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.”
Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face
upon it.
“Don’t despond,” said Carton, very gently; “don’t grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be
consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think ‘his life was want only
thrown away or wasted,’ and that might trouble her.”
“Yes, yes, yes,” returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, “you are right.
But he will perish; there is no real hope.”
295
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,” echoed Carton.
And walked with a settled step, down-stairs.
Chapter 12
Darkness
Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. “At
Tellson’s banking-house at nine,” he said, with a musing face. “Shall I
do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that
these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound
precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care!
Let me think it out!”
Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he
took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the
thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression
was confirmed. “It is best,” he said, finally resolved, “that these people
should know there is such a man as I here.” And he turned his face
towards Saint Antoine.
Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wineshop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew
the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having
ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again,
and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner.
For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night
he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had
dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry’s hearth like a man who
had done with it.
It was as late as seven o’clock when he awoke refreshed, and went
out into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he
stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered
the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and
his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge’s, and went in.
There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of
the restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen
upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with
the Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation,
like a regular member of the establishment.
296
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
As Carton walked in, took his seat and asked (in very indifferent
French) for a small measure of wine, Madame Defarge cast a careless
glance at him, and then a keener, and then a keener, and then advanced
to him herself, and asked him what it was he had ordered.
He repeated what he had already said.
“English?” asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark
eyebrows.
After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word
were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong
foreign accent. “Yes, madame, yes. I am English!”
Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he
took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its
meaning, he heard her say, “I swear to you, like Evremonde!”
Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening.
“How?”
“Good evening.”
“Oh! Good evening, citizen,” filling his glass. “Ah! and good wine.
I drink to the Republic.”
Defarge went back to the counter, and said, “Certainly, a little like.”
Madame sternly retorted, “I tell you a good deal like.” Jacques Three
pacifically remarked, “He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.”
The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, “Yes, my faith! And you
are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more
to-morrow!”
Carton followed the lines and words of his paper, with a slow forefinger, and with a studious and absorbed face. They were all leaning
their arms on the counter close together, speaking low. After a silence
of a few moments, during which they all looked towards him without
disturbing his outward attention from the Jacobin editor, they resumed
their conversation.
“It is true what madame says,” observed Jacques Three. “Why stop?
There is great force in that. Why stop?”
“Well, well,” reasoned Defarge, “but one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?”
“At extermination,” said madame.
“Magnificent!” croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly
approved.
“Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,” said Defarge, rather
troubled; “in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suf297
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when
the paper was read.”
“I have observed his face!” repeated madame, contemptuously and
angrily. “Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be
not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his
face!”
“And you have observed, my wife,” said Defarge, in a deprecatory
manner, “the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish
to him!”
“I have observed his daughter,” repeated madame; “yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day,
and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court,
and I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my
finger—!” She seemed to raise it (the listener’s eyes were always on his
paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the
axe had dropped.
“The citizeness is superb!” croaked the Juryman.
“She is an Angel!” said The Vengeance, and embraced her.
“As to thee,” pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband,
“if it depended on thee—which, happily, it does not—thou wouldst rescue this man even now.”
“No!” protested Defarge. “Not if to lift this glass would do it! But
I would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.”
“See you then, Jacques,” said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; “and
see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other
crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my
register, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is
that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge, without being asked.
“In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds
this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the
night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by
the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge.
“That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the
lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and
between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask
him, is that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge again.
298
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these
two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, ‘Defarge, I was brought
up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so
injured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes,
is my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon
the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister’s husband, that
unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father
was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer
for those things descends to me!’ Ask him, is that so.”
“It is so,” assented Defarge once more.
“Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,” returned madame; “but
don’t tell me.”
Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath—the listener could feel how white she was, without
seeing her—and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority,
interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of
the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last
reply. “Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!”
Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English
customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change,
and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace.
Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in
pointing out the road. The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lift it, and
strike under it sharp and deep.
But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of
the prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present
himself in Mr. Lorry’s room again, where he found the old gentleman
walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie
until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and
keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted
the banking-house towards four o’clock. She had some faint hopes that
his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had
been more than five hours gone: where could he be?
Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and
he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he
should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight.
In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor.
He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor
299
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Manette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings
of him, and brought none. Where could he be?
They were discussing this question, and were almost building up
some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard
him on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all
was lost.
Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all
that time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring
at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything.
“I cannot find it,” said he, “and I must have it. Where is it?”
His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look
straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor.
“Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench,
and I can’t find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I
must finish those shoes.”
They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.
“Come, come!” said he, in a whimpering miserable way; “let me get
to work. Give me my work.”
Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the
ground, like a distracted child.
“Don’t torture a poor forlorn wretch,” he implored them, with a
dreadful cry; “but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those
shoes are not done to-night?”
Lost, utterly lost!
It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore
him, that—as if by agreement—they each put a hand upon his shoulder,
and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he
should have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded
over the embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the
garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him
shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping.
Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely
daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both
too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with
one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak:
“The last chance is gone: it was not much. Yes; he had better be
taken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend
to me? Don’t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make,
300
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason—a good
one.”
“I do not doubt it,” answered Mr. Lorry. “Say on.”
The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously
rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as
they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the
night.
Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his
feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to
carry the lists of his day’s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it
up, and there was a folded paper in it. “We should look at this!” he said.
Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, “Thank
God!”
“What is it?” asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly.
“A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,” he put his hand
in his coat, and took another paper from it, “that is the certificate which
enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see—Sydney Carton,
an Englishman?”
Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face.
“Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you
remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.”
“Why not?”
“I don’t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling
him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and
the frontier! You see?”
“Yes!”
“Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against
evil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don’t stay to look; put
it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted
until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper.
It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason
to think, will be.”
“They are not in danger?”
“They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by
Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words
of that woman’s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in
strong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy.
He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison
301
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by
Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her”—he never mentioned Lucie’s name—“making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee
that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will
involve her life—and perhaps her child’s—and perhaps her father’s—for
both have been seen with her at that place. Don’t look so horrified. You
will save them all.”
“Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?”
“I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could
depend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not
take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days
afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital
crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She
and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this
woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would
wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure.
You follow me?”
“So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that
for the moment I lose sight,” touching the back of the Doctor’s chair,
even of this distress.“
“You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to the seacoast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have
been completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow
have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two
o’clock in the afternoon.”
“It shall be done!”
His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the
flame, and was as quick as youth.
“You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better
man? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving
her child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own
fair head beside her husband’s cheerfully.” He faltered for an instant;
then went on as before. “For the sake of her child and her father, press
upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour.
Tell her that it was her husband’s last arrangement. Tell her that more
depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her
father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?”
“I am sure of it.”
“I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements
302
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
made in the courtyard here, even to the taking of your own seat in
the carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.”
“I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?”
“You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and
will reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied,
and then for England!”
“Why, then,” said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and
steady hand, “it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a
young and ardent man at my side.”
“By the help of Heaven you shall! Promise me solemnly that nothing
will influence you to alter the course on which we now stand pledged to
one another.”
“Nothing, Carton.”
“Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in
it—for any reason—and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives
must inevitably be sacrificed.”
“I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.”
“And I hope to do mine. Now, good bye!”
Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though
he even put the old man’s hand to his lips, he did not part from him
then. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying
embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth
to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly
besought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to
the courtyard of the house where the afflicted heart—so happy in the
memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it—
outwatched the awful night. He entered the courtyard and remained
there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of
her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and
a Farewell.
Chapter 13
Fifty-two
In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited
their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two
were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless
303
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were
appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the
blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart.
Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty,
whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all
degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction.
Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the
narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully
comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that
he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail
him nothing.
Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. His hold on life
was strong, and it was very, very hard, to loosen; by gradual efforts and
degrees unclosed a little here, it clenched the tighter there; and when
he brought his strength to bear on that hand and it yielded, this was
closed again. There was a hurry, too, in all his thoughts, a turbulent
and heated working of his heart, that contended against resignation. If,
for a moment, he did feel resigned, then his wife and child who had to
live after him, seemed to protest and to make it a selfish thing.
But, all this was at first. Before long, the consideration that there was
no disgrace in the fate he must meet, and that numbers went the same
road wrongfully, and trod it firmly every day, sprang up to stimulate
him. Next followed the thought that much of the future peace of mind
enjoyable by the dear ones, depended on his quiet fortitude. So, by
degrees he calmed into the better state, when he could raise his thoughts
much higher, and draw comfort down.
Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had
travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means
of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison
lamps should be extinguished.
He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known
nothing of her father’s imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father’s and uncle’s
304
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had
already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name
he had relinquished, was the one condition—fully intelligible now—that
her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he
had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for
her father’s sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become
oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him
(for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old
Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved
any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had
supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention
of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered
there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her—
though he added that he knew it was needless—to console her father, by
impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the
truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to
her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured
her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father.
To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her
father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care. And he
told him this, very strongly, with the hope of rousing him from any despondency or dangerous retrospect towards which he foresaw he might
be tending.
To Mr. Lorry, he commended them all, and explained his worldly
affairs. That done, with many added sentences of grateful friendship
and warm attachment, all was done. He never thought of Carton. His
mind was so full of the others, that he never once thought of him.
He had time to finish these letters before the lights were put out.
When he lay down on his straw bed, he thought he had done with this
world.
But, it beckoned him back in his sleep, and showed itself in shining
forms. Free and happy, back in the old house in Soho (though it had
nothing in it like the real house), unaccountably released and light of
heart, he was with Lucie again, and she told him it was all a dream, and
he had never gone away. A pause of forgetfulness, and then he had even
suffered, and had come back to her, dead and at peace, and yet there
was no difference in him. Another pause of oblivion, and he awoke in
305
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the sombre morning, unconscious where he was or what had happened,
until it flashed upon his mind, “this is the day of my death!”
Thus, had he come through the hours, to the day when the fifty-two
heads were to fall. And now, while he was composed, and hoped that
he could meet the end with quiet heroism, a new action began in his
waking thoughts, which was very difficult to master.
He had never seen the instrument that was to terminate his life. How
high it was from the ground, how many steps it had, where he would be
stood, how he would be touched, whether the touching hands would be
dyed red, which way his face would be turned, whether he would be the
first, or might be the last: these and many similar questions, in nowise
directed by his will, obtruded themselves over and over again, countless
times. Neither were they connected with fear: he was conscious of no
fear. Rather, they originated in a strange besetting desire to know what
to do when the time came; a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
few swift moments to which it referred; a wondering that was more like
the wondering of some other spirit within his, than his own.
The hours went on as he walked to and fro, and the clocks struck the
numbers he would never hear again. Nine gone for ever, ten gone for
ever, eleven gone for ever, twelve coming on to pass away. After a hard
contest with that eccentric action of thought which had last perplexed
him, he had got the better of it. He walked up and down, softly repeating their names to himself. The worst of the strife was over. He could
walk up and down, free from distracting fancies, praying for himself
and for them.
Twelve gone for ever.
He had been apprised that the final hour was Three, and he knew he
would be summoned some time earlier, inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted
heavily and slowly through the streets. Therefore, he resolved to keep
Two before his mind, as the hour, and so to strengthen himself in the
interval that he might be able, after that time, to strengthen others.
Walking regularly to and fro with his arms folded on his breast, a
very different man from the prisoner, who had walked to and fro at La
Force, he heard One struck away from him, without surprise. The hour
had measured like most other hours. Devoutly thankful to Heaven for
his recovered self-possession, he thought, “There is but another now,”
and turned to walk again.
Footsteps in the stone passage outside the door. He stopped.
The key was put in the lock, and turned. Before the door was opened,
306
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
or as it opened, a man said in a low voice, in English: “He has never
seen me here; I have kept out of his way. Go you in alone; I wait near.
Lose no time!”
The door was quickly opened and closed, and there stood before
him face to face, quiet, intent upon him, with the light of a smile on his
features, and a cautionary finger on his lip, Sydney Carton.
There was something so bright and remarkable in his look, that, for
the first moment, the prisoner misdoubted him to be an apparition of
his own imagining. But, he spoke, and it was his voice; he took the
prisoner’s hand, and it was his real grasp.
“Of all the people upon earth, you least expected to see me?” he
said.
“I could not believe it to be you. I can scarcely believe it now.
You are not”—the apprehension came suddenly into his mind—“a prisoner?”
“No. I am accidentally possessed of a power over one of the keepers
here, and in virtue of it I stand before you. I come from her—your wife,
dear Darnay.”
The prisoner wrung his hand.
“I bring you a request from her.”
“What is it?”
“A most earnest, pressing, and emphatic entreaty, addressed to you
in the most pathetic tones of the voice so dear to you, that you well
remember.”
The prisoner turned his face partly aside.
“You have no time to ask me why I bring it, or what it means; I have
no time to tell you. You must comply with it—take off those boots you
wear, and draw on these of mine.”
There was a chair against the wall of the cell, behind the prisoner.
Carton, pressing forward, had already, with the speed of lightning, got
him down into it, and stood over him, barefoot.
“Draw on these boots of mine. Put your hands to them; put your
will to them. Quick!”
“Carton, there is no escaping from this place; it never can be done.
You will only die with me. It is madness.”
“It would be madness if I asked you to escape; but do I? When I
ask you to pass out at that door, tell me it is madness and remain here.
Change that cravat for this of mine, that coat for this of mine. While
you do it, let me take this ribbon from your hair, and shake out your
307
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
hair like this of mine!”
With wonderful quickness, and with a strength both of will and action, that appeared quite supernatural, he forced all these changes upon
him. The prisoner was like a young child in his hands.
“Carton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished,
it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I
implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.”
“Do I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that,
refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand
steady enough to write?”
“It was when you came in.”
“Steady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend,
quick!”
Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the
table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him.
“Write exactly as I speak.”
“To whom do I address it?”
“To no one.” Carton still had his hand in his breast.
“Do I date it?”
“No.”
The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over
him with his hand in his breast, looked down.
“ ‘If you remember,’ ” said Carton, dictating, “ ‘the words that
passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when
you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to
forget them.’ ”
He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to
look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing
upon something.
“Have you written ‘forget them’?” Carton asked.
“I have. Is that a weapon in your hand?”
“No; I am not armed.”
“What is it in your hand?”
“You shall know directly. Write on; there are but a few words more.”
He dictated again. “ ‘I am thankful that the time has come, when I can
prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief.’ ” As he said
these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly
moved down close to the writer’s face.
The pen dropped from Darnay’s fingers on the table, and he looked
308
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
about him vacantly.
“What vapour is that?” he asked.
“Vapour?”
“Something that crossed me?”
“I am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the
pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!”
As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton
with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton—
his hand again in his breast—looked steadily at him.
“Hurry, hurry!”
The prisoner bent over the paper, once more.
“ ‘If it had been otherwise;’ ” Carton’s hand was again watchfully
and softly stealing down; “ ‘I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;’ ” the hand was at the prisoner’s face;
“ ‘I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been
otherwise—’ ” Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into
unintelligible signs.
Carton’s hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner
sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton’s hand was close and
firm at his nostrils, and Carton’s left arm caught him round the waist.
For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to
lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched
insensible on the ground.
Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed
back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then,
he softly called, “Enter there! Come in!” and the Spy presented himself.
“You see?” said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee
beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: “is your
hazard very great?”
“Mr. Carton,” the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers,
“my hazard is not that, in the thick of business here, if you are true to
the whole of your bargain.”
“Don’t fear me. I will be true to the death.”
“You must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being
made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.”
“Have no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and
the rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and
309
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
take me to the coach.”
“You?” said the Spy nervously.
“Him, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate
by which you brought me in?”
“Of course.”
“I was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter
now you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such
a thing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your
own hands. Quick! Call assistance!”
“You swear not to betray me?” said the trembling Spy, as he paused
for a last moment.
“Man, man!” returned Carton, stamping his foot; “have I sworn
by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the
precious moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know
of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry,
tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my
words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!”
The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his
forehead on his hands. The Spy returned immediately, with two men.
“How, then?” said one of them, contemplating the fallen figure. “So
afflicted to find that his friend has drawn a prize in the lottery of Sainte
Guillotine?”
“A good patriot,” said the other, “could hardly have been more afflicted if the Aristocrat had drawn a blank.”
They raised the unconscious figure, placed it on a litter they had
brought to the door, and bent to carry it away.
“The time is short, Evremonde,” said the Spy, in a warning voice.
“I know it well,” answered Carton. “Be careful of my friend, I
entreat you, and leave me.”
“Come, then, my children,” said Barsad. “Lift him, and come
away!”
The door closed, and Carton was left alone. Straining his powers of
listening to the utmost, he listened for any sound that might denote suspicion or alarm. There was none. Keys turned, doors clashed, footsteps
passed along distant passages: no cry was raised, or hurry made, that
seemed unusual. Breathing more freely in a little while, he sat down at
the table, and listened again until the clock struck Two.
Sounds that he was not afraid of, for he divined their meaning, then
began to be audible. Several doors were opened in succession, and fi310
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
nally his own. A gaoler, with a list in his hand, looked in, merely saying,
“Follow me, Evremonde!” and he followed into a large dark room, at a
distance. It was a dark winter day, and what with the shadows within,
and what with the shadows without, he could but dimly discern the
others who were brought there to have their arms bound. Some were
standing; some seated. Some were lamenting, and in restless motion;
but, these were few. The great majority were silent and still, looking
fixedly at the ground.
As he stood by the wall in a dim corner, while some of the fiftytwo were brought in after him, one man stopped in passing, to embrace
him, as having a knowledge of him. It thrilled him with a great dread
of discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a
young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which
there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes,
rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak
to him.
“Citizen Evremonde,” she said, touching him with her cold hand. “I
am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.”
He murmured for answer: “True. I forget what you were accused
of?”
“Plots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is
it likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature
like me?”
The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears
started from his eyes.
“I am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing.
I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good
to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be,
Citizen Evremonde. Such a poor weak little creature!”
As the last thing on earth that his heart was to warm and soften to,
it warmed and softened to this pitiable girl.
“I heard you were released, Citizen Evremonde. I hoped it was
true?”
“It was. But, I was again taken and condemned.”
“If I may ride with you, Citizen Evremonde, will you let me hold
your hand? I am not afraid, but I am little and weak, and it will give
me more courage.”
As the patient eyes were lifted to his face, he saw a sudden doubt in
them, and then astonishment. He pressed the work-worn, hunger-worn
311
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
young fingers, and touched his lips.
“Are you dying for him?” she whispered.
“And his wife and child. Hush! Yes.”
“O you will let me hold your brave hand, stranger?”
“Hush! Yes, my poor sister; to the last.”
The same shadows that are falling on the prison, are falling, in that
same hour of the early afternoon, on the Barrier with the crowd about
it, when a coach going out of Paris drives up to be examined.
“Who goes here? Whom have we within? Papers!”
The papers are handed out, and read.
“Alexandre Manette. Physician. French. Which is he?”
This is he; this helpless, inarticulately murmuring, wandering old
man pointed out.
“Apparently the Citizen-Doctor is not in his right mind? The
Revolution-fever will have been too much for him?”
Greatly too much for him.
“Hah! Many suffer with it. Lucie. His daughter. French. Which is
she?”
This is she.
“Apparently it must be. Lucie, the wife of Evremonde; is it not?”
It is.
“Hah! Evremonde has an assignation elsewhere. Lucie, her child.
English. This is she?”
She and no other.
“Kiss me, child of Evremonde. Now, thou hast kissed a good Republican; something new in thy family; remember it! Sydney Carton.
Advocate. English. Which is he?”
He lies here, in this corner of the carriage. He, too, is pointed out.
“Apparently the English advocate is in a swoon?”
It is hoped he will recover in the fresher air. It is represented that
he is not in strong health, and has separated sadly from a friend who is
under the displeasure of the Republic.
“Is that all? It is not a great deal, that! Many are under the displeasure of the Republic, and must look out at the little window. Jarvis
Lorry. Banker. English. Which is he?”
“I am he. Necessarily, being the last.”
It is Jarvis Lorry who has replied to all the previous questions. It is
Jarvis Lorry who has alighted and stands with his hand on the coach
door, replying to a group of officials. They leisurely walk round the
312
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
carriage and leisurely mount the box, to look at what little luggage
it carries on the roof; the country-people hanging about, press nearer
to the coach doors and greedily stare in; a little child, carried by its
mother, has its short arm held out for it, that it may touch the wife of
an aristocrat who has gone to the Guillotine.
“Behold your papers, Jarvis Lorry, countersigned.”
“One can depart, citizen?”
“One can depart. Forward, my postilions! A good journey!”
“I salute you, citizens.—And the first danger passed!”
These are again the words of Jarvis Lorry, as he clasps his hands, and
looks upward. There is terror in the carriage, there is weeping, there is
the heavy breathing of the insensible traveller.
“Are we not going too slowly? Can they not be induced to go
faster?” asks Lucie, clinging to the old man.
“It would seem like flight, my darling. I must not urge them too
much; it would rouse suspicion.”
“Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued!”
“The road is clear, my dearest. So far, we are not pursued.”
Houses in twos and threes pass by us, solitary farms, ruinous buildings, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, open country, avenues of leafless trees. The hard uneven pavement is under us, the soft deep mud
is on either side. Sometimes, we strike into the skirting mud, to avoid
the stones that clatter us and shake us; sometimes, we stick in ruts and
sloughs there. The agony of our impatience is then so great, that in
our wild alarm and hurry we are for getting out and running—hiding—
doing anything but stopping.
Out of the open country, in again among ruinous buildings, solitary
farms, dye-works, tanneries, and the like, cottages in twos and threes,
avenues of leafless trees. Have these men deceived us, and taken us back
by another road? Is not this the same place twice over? Thank Heaven,
no. A village. Look back, look back, and see if we are pursued! Hush!
the posting-house.
Leisurely, our four horses are taken out; leisurely, the coach stands
in the little street, bereft of horses, and with no likelihood upon it of
ever moving again; leisurely, the new horses come into visible existence,
one by one; leisurely, the new postilions follow, sucking and plaiting
the lashes of their whips; leisurely, the old postilions count their money,
make wrong additions, and arrive at dissatisfied results. All the time,
our overfraught hearts are beating at a rate that would far outstrip the
313
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
fastest gallop of the fastest horses ever foaled.
At length the new postilions are in their saddles, and the old are left
behind. We are through the village, up the hill, and down the hill, and
on the low watery grounds. Suddenly, the postilions exchange speech
with animated gesticulation, and the horses are pulled up, almost on
their haunches. We are pursued?
“Ho! Within the carriage there. Speak then!”
“What is it?” asks Mr. Lorry, looking out at window.
“How many did they say?”
“I do not understand you.”
“—At the last post. How many to the Guillotine to-day?”
“Fifty-two.”
“I said so! A brave number! My fellow-citizen here would have
it forty-two; ten more heads are worth having. The Guillotine goes
handsomely. I love it. Hi forward. Whoop!”
The night comes on dark. He moves more; he is beginning to revive,
and to speak intelligibly; he thinks they are still together; he asks him,
by his name, what he has in his hand. O pity us, kind Heaven, and help
us! Look out, look out, and see if we are pursued.
The wind is rushing after us, and the clouds are flying after us, and
the moon is plunging after us, and the whole wild night is in pursuit of
us; but, so far, we are pursued by nothing else.
Chapter 14
The Knitting Done
In that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate
Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and
Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did
Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the
wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer
satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion
until invited.
“But our Defarge,” said Jacques Three, “is undoubtedly a good Republican? Eh?”
314
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“There is no better,” the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill
notes, “in France.”
“Peace, little Vengeance,” said Madame Defarge, laying her hand
with a slight frown on her lieutenant’s lips, “hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this
Doctor.”
“It is a great pity,” croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his
head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; “it is not quite like a
good citizen; it is a thing to regret.”
“See you,” said madame, “I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may
wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to
me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife
and child must follow the husband and father.”
“She has a fine head for it,” croaked Jacques Three. “I have seen
blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.” Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure.
Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little.
“The child also,” observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, “has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have
a child there. It is a pretty sight!”
“In a word,” said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, “I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since
last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but
also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then
they might escape.”
“That must never be,” croaked Jacques Three; “no one must escape.
We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.”
“In a word,” Madame Defarge went on, “my husband has not my
reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason
for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself,
therefore. Come hither, little citizen.”
The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the
submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.
“Touching those signals, little citizen,” said Madame Defarge,
sternly, “that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness
to them this very day?”
“Ay, ay, why not!” cried the sawyer. “Every day, in all weathers,
315
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.”
He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental
imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never
seen.
“Clearly plots,” said Jacques Three. “Transparently!”
“There is no doubt of the Jury?” inquired Madame Defarge, letting
her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile.
“Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellowJurymen.”
“Now, let me see,” said Madame Defarge, pondering again. “Yet
once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling
either way. Can I spare him?”
“He would count as one head,” observed Jacques Three, in a low
voice. “We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.”
“He was signalling with her when I saw her,” argued Madame Defarge; “I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent,
and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a
bad witness.”
The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of
witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a
celestial witness.
“He must take his chance,” said Madame Defarge. “No, I cannot
spare him! You are engaged at three o’clock; you are going to see the
batch of to-day executed.—You?”
The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly
replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the
most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll
national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might
have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge’s head) of having his small
individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day.
“I,” said madame, “am equally engaged at the same place. After it
is over-say at eight to-night—come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we
will give information against these people at my Section.”
The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend
316
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
the citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed,
evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his
wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw.
Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little
nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus:
“She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She
will be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach
the justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies.
I will go to her.”
“What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!” exclaimed
Jacques Three, rapturously. “Ah, my cherished!” cried The Vengeance;
and embraced her.
“Take you my knitting,” said Madame Defarge, placing it in her
lieutenant’s hands, “and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep
me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a
greater concourse than usual, to-day.”
“I willingly obey the orders of my Chief,” said The Vengeance with
alacrity, and kissing her cheek. “You will not be late?”
“I shall be there before the commencement.”
“And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,”
said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into
the street, “before the tumbrils arrive!”
Madame Defarge slightly waved her hand, to imply that she heard,
and might be relied upon to arrive in good time, and so went through
the mud, and round the corner of the prison wall. The Vengeance and
the Juryman, looking after her as she walked away, were highly appreciative of her fine figure, and her superb moral endowments.
There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a
dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more
to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the
streets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness,
of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to
impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others
an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would
have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her
childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of
a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely
without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out
of her.
317
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins
of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her,
that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that
was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and
her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made
hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had
been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which
she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had
been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any
softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who
sent here there.
Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and
her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her
bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened
dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such
a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown
sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets.
Now, when the journey of the travelling coach, at that very moment
waiting for the completion of its load, had been planned out last night,
the difficulty of taking Miss Pross in it had much engaged Mr. Lorry’s
attention. It was not merely desirable to avoid overloading the coach,
but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their escape
might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there. Finally,
he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry,
who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o’clock in
the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered
with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and
preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly
facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay
was the most to be dreaded.
Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
318
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.
“Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,” said Miss Pross, whose
agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move,
or live: “what do you think of our not starting from this courtyard?
Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken
suspicion.”
“My opinion, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “is as you’re right.
Likewise wot I’ll stand by you, right or wrong.”
“I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,”
said Miss Pross, wildly crying, “that I am incapable of forming any plan.
Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?”
“Respectin’ a future spear o’ life, miss,” returned Mr. Cruncher, “I
hope so. Respectin’ any present use o’ this here blessed old head o’ mind,
I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o’ two
promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?”
“Oh, for gracious sake!” cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying,
“record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent
man.”
“First,” said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke
with an ashy and solemn visage, “them poor things well out o’ this,
never no more will I do it, never no more!”
“I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,” returned Miss Pross, “that you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is.”
“No, miss,” returned Jerry, “it shall not be named to you. Second:
them poor things well out o’ this, and never no more will I interfere
with Mrs. Cruncher’s flopping, never no more!”
“Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,” said Miss
Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, “I have no doubt
it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own
superintendence.—O my poor darlings!”
“I go so far as to say, miss, moreover,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with
a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit—“and let my
words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself—that
wot my opinions respectin’ flopping has undergone a change, and that
wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping
at the present time.”
“There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,” cried the distracted Miss Pross, “and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.”
319
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“Forbid it,” proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out,
“as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn’t
all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get ’em out o’ this here dismal
risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for-bid it!” This was Mr. Cruncher’s
conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.
And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.
“If we ever get back to our native land,” said Miss Pross, “you may
rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at
all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My
esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!”
Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.
“If you were to go before,” said Miss Pross, “and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me;
wouldn’t that be best?”
Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best.
“Where could you wait for me?” asked Miss Pross.
Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality
but Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and
Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed.
“By the cathedral door,” said Miss Pross. “Would it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?”
“No, miss,” answered Mr. Cruncher.
“Then, like the best of men,” said Miss Pross, “go to the postinghouse straight, and make that change.”
“I am doubtful,” said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
“about leaving of you, you see. We don’t know what may happen.”
“Heaven knows we don’t,” returned Miss Pross, “but have no fear
for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o’Clock, or as near it as
you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel
certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of
the lives that may depend on both of us!”
This exordium, and Miss Pross’s two hands in quite agonised en320
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
treaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or
two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by
herself to follow as she had proposed.
The having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets,
was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes
past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.
Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions,
she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by
the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that
there was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and
cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.
The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet
of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining
blood, those feet had come to meet that water.
Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, “The wife of Evremonde; where is she?”
It flashed upon Miss Pross’s mind that the doors were all standing
open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There
were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself
before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied.
Madame Defarge’s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing
beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the
grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in
her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes,
every inch.
“You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,” said
Miss Pross, in her breathing. “Nevertheless, you shall not get the better
of me. I am an Englishwoman.”
Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something
of Miss Pross’s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a
tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same
figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full
well that Miss Pross was the family’s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew
321
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
full well that Madame Defarge was the family’s malevolent enemy.
“On my way yonder,” said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, “where they reserve my chair
and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in
passing. I wish to see her.”
“I know that your intentions are evil,” said Miss Pross, “and you
may depend upon it, I’ll hold my own against them.”
Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other’s
words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and
manner, what the unintelligible words meant.
“It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,” said Madame Defarge. “Good patriots will know what that
means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?”
“If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,” returned Miss Pross,
“and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn’t loose a splinter of me.
No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.”
Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks
in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught.
“Woman imbecile and pig-like!” said Madame Defarge, frowning.
“I take no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I
demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to
her!” This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.
“I little thought,” said Miss Pross, “that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except
the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part
of it.”
Neither of them for a single moment released the other’s eyes.
Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when
Miss Pross first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.
“I am a Briton,” said Miss Pross, “I am desperate. I don’t care an
English Twopence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here,
the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I’ll not leave a handful of
that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!”
Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.
Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life.
But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the
irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame De322
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
farge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. “Ha, ha!” she
laughed, “you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to
that Doctor.” Then she raised her voice and called out, “Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this
miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!”
Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of Miss Pross’s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone.
Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.
“Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing,
there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room
behind you! Let me look.”
“Never!” said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly
as Madame Defarge understood the answer.
“If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,” said Madame Defarge to herself.
“As long as you don’t know whether they are in that room or not,
you are uncertain what to do,” said Miss Pross to herself; “and you
shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that,
or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.”
“I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,” said
Madame Defarge.
“We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard,
we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep
you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand
guineas to my darling,” said Miss Pross.
Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of
the moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her
tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss
Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than
hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore
her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist,
and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.
Soon, Madame Defarge’s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. “It is under my arm,” said Miss Pross, in smothered tones,
“you shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I
hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!”
323
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Madame Defarge’s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up,
saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone—blinded with smoke.
All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground.
In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of
what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to
go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get
the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out
on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the
key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to
cry, and then got up and hurried away.
By good fortune she had a veil on her bonnet, or she could hardly
have gone along the streets without being stopped. By good fortune,
too, she was naturally so peculiar in appearance as not to show disfigurement like any other woman. She needed both advantages, for the
marks of gripping fingers were deep in her face, and her hair was torn,
and her dress (hastily composed with unsteady hands) was clutched and
dragged a hundred ways.
In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting
there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if
it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged
with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.
“Is there any noise in the streets?” she asked him.
“The usual noises,” Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by
the question and by her aspect.
“I don’t hear you,” said Miss Pross. “What do you say?”
It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross
could not hear him. “So I’ll nod my head,” thought Mr. Cruncher,
amazed, “at all events she’ll see that.” And she did.
“Is there any noise in the streets now?” asked Miss Pross again,
presently.
Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head.
324
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
“I don’t hear it.”
“Gone deaf in an hour?” said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his
mind much disturbed; “wot’s come to her?”
“I feel,” said Miss Pross, “as if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.”
“Blest if she ain’t in a queer condition!” said Mr. Cruncher, more
and more disturbed. “Wot can she have been a takin’, to keep her
courage up? Hark! There’s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can
hear that, miss?”
“I can hear,” said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, “nothing.
O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.”
“If she don’t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh
their journey’s end,” said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, “it’s
my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.”
And indeed she never did.
Chapter 15
The Footsteps Die Out For Ever
Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six
tumbrils carry the day’s wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and
insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are
fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France,
with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a
peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain
than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape
once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same
tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression
over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind.
Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what
they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be
the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the
toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father’s house
but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the
great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the
325
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
Creator, never reverses his transformations. “If thou be changed into
this shape by the will of God,” say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise
Arabian stories, “then remain so! But, if thou wear this form through
mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!” Changeless
and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.
As the sombre wheels of the six carts go round, they seem to plough
up a long crooked furrow among the populace in the streets. Ridges of
faces are thrown to this side and to that, and the ploughs go steadily onward. So used are the regular inhabitants of the houses to the spectacle,
that in many windows there are no people, and in some the occupation
of the hands is not so much as suspended, while the eyes survey the
faces in the tumbrils. Here and there, the inmate has visitors to see the
sight; then he points his finger, with something of the complacency of
a curator or authorised exponent, to this cart and to this, and seems to
tell who sat here yesterday, and who there the day before.
Of the riders in the tumbrils, some observe these things, and all
things on their last roadside, with an impassive stare; others, with a
lingering interest in the ways of life and men. Some, seated with drooping heads, are sunk in silent despair; again, there are some so heedful of
their looks that they cast upon the multitude such glances as they have
seen in theatres, and in pictures. Several close their eyes, and think, or
try to get their straying thoughts together. Only one, and he a miserable
creature, of a crazed aspect, is so shattered and made drunk by horror,
that he sings, and tries to dance. Not one of the whole number appeals
by look or gesture, to the pity of the people.
There is a guard of sundry horsemen riding abreast of the tumbrils,
and faces are often turned up to some of them, and they are asked
some question. It would seem to be always the same question, for, it
is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The
horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with
their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands
at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a
mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no
curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl.
Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against
him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his
hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face,
his arms being bound.
On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils,
326
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
stands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not
there. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself,
“Has he sacrificed me?” when his face clears, as he looks into the third.
“Which is Evremonde?” says a man behind him.
“That. At the back there.”
“With his hand in the girl’s?”
“Yes.”
The man cries, “Down, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats!
Down, Evremonde!”
“Hush, hush!” the Spy entreats him, timidly.
“And why not, citizen?”
“He is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more.
Let him be at peace.”
But the man continuing to exclaim, “Down, Evremonde!” the face
of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then
sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way.
The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed
among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of
execution, and end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now
crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are
following to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting. On
one of the fore-most chairs, stands The Vengeance, looking about for
her friend.
“Therese!” she cries, in her shrill tones. “Who has seen her? Therese
Defarge!”
“She never missed before,” says a knitting-woman of the sisterhood.
“No; nor will she miss now,” cries The Vengeance, petulantly.
“Therese.”
“Louder,” the woman recommends.
Ay! Louder, Vengeance, much louder, and still she will scarcely hear
thee. Louder yet, Vengeance, with a little oath or so added, and yet
it will hardly bring her. Send other women up and down to seek her,
lingering somewhere; and yet, although the messengers have done dread
deeds, it is questionable whether of their own wills they will go far
enough to find her!
“Bad Fortune!” cries The Vengeance, stamping her foot in the chair,
“and here are the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a
wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty
327
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
chair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!”
As The Vengeance descends from her elevation to do it, the tumbrils
begin to discharge their loads. The ministers of Sainte Guillotine are
robed and ready. Crash!—A head is held up, and the knitting-women
who scarcely lifted their eyes to look at it a moment ago when it could
think and speak, count One.
The second tumbril empties and moves on; the third comes up.
Crash!—And the knitting-women, never faltering or pausing in their
Work, count Two.
The supposed Evremonde descends, and the seamstress is lifted out
next after him. He has not relinquished her patient hand in getting out,
but still holds it as he promised. He gently places her with her back to
the crashing engine that constantly whirrs up and falls, and she looks
into his face and thanks him.
“But for you, dear stranger, I should not be so composed, for I am
naturally a poor little thing, faint of heart; nor should I have been able
to raise my thoughts to Him who was put to death, that we might have
hope and comfort here to-day. I think you were sent to me by Heaven.”
“Or you to me,” says Sydney Carton. “Keep your eyes upon me,
dear child, and mind no other object.”
“I mind nothing while I hold your hand. I shall mind nothing when
I let it go, if they are rapid.”
“They will be rapid. Fear not!”
The two stand in the fast-thinning throng of victims, but they speak
as if they were alone. Eye to eye, voice to voice, hand to hand, heart
to heart, these two children of the Universal Mother, else so wide apart
and differing, have come together on the dark highway, to repair home
together, and to rest in her bosom.
“Brave and generous friend, will you let me ask you one last question? I am very ignorant, and it troubles me—just a little.”
“Tell me what it is.”
“I have a cousin, an only relative and an orphan, like myself, whom
I love very dearly. She is five years younger than I, and she lives in a
farmer’s house in the south country. Poverty parted us, and she knows
nothing of my fate—for I cannot write—and if I could, how should I
tell her! It is better as it is.”
“Yes, yes: better as it is.”
“What I have been thinking as we came along, and what I am still
thinking now, as I look into your kind strong face which gives me so
328
A T A L E O F T W O C I T I E S
much support, is this:—If the Republic really does good to the poor,
and they come to be less hungry, and in all ways to suffer less, she may
live a long time: she may even live to be old.”
“What then, my gentle sister?”
“Do you think:” the uncomplaining eyes in which there is so much
endurance, fill with tears, and the lips part a little more and tremble:
“that it will seem long to me, while I wait for her in the better land

“It cannot be, my child; there is no Time there, and no trouble

“You comfort me so much! I am so ignorant. Am I to kiss you now?
Is the moment come?”
“Yes.”
She kisses his lips; he kisses hers; they solemnly bless each other.
The spare hand does not tremble as he releases it; nothing worse than
a sweet, bright constancy is in the patient face. She goes next before
him—is gone; the knitting-women count Twenty-Two.
“I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and
believeth in me shall never die.”

pressing on of many footsteps in the outskirts of the crowd, so that it
swells forward in a mass, like one great heave of water, all flashes away.

They said of him, about the city that night, that it was the peacefullest man’s face ever beheld there. Many added that he looked sublime
and prophetic.
One of the most remarkable sufferers by the same axe—a woman—
had asked at the foot of the same scaffold, not long before, to be allowed
to write down the thoughts that were inspiring her. If he had given any
utterance to his, and they were prophetic, they would have been these:
“I see Barsad, and Cly, Defarge, The Vengeance, the Juryman, the
Judge, long ranks of the new oppressors who have risen on the destruction of the old, perishing by this retributive instrument, before it shall
cease out of its present use. I see a beautiful city and a brilliant people
rising from this abyss, and, in their struggles to be truly free, in their
triumphs and defeats, through long years to come, I see the evil of this
time and of the previous time of which this is the natural birth, gradually making expiation for itself and wearing out.

“I see the lives for which I lay down my life, peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy, in that England which I shall see no more. I see Her
with a child upon her bosom, who bears my name. I see her father, aged
and bent, but otherwise restored, and faithful to all men in his healing
office, and at peace. I see the good old man, so long their friend, in ten
years’ time enriching them with all he has, and passing tranquilly to his
reward.
“I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of
their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping
for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their
course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that
each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other’s soul, than I
was in the souls of both.
“I see that child who lay upon her bosom and who bore my name,
a man winning his way up in that path of life which once was mine. I
see him winning it so well, that my name is made illustrious there by
the light of his. I see the blots I threw upon it, faded away. I see him,
fore-most of just judges and honoured men, bringing a boy of my name,
with a forehead that I know and golden hair, to this place—then fair to
look upon, with not a trace of this day’s disfigurement—and I hear him
tell the child my story, with a tender and a faltering voice.
“It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far,
far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”

The world’s
most precise
replica
of the world’s
most famous
children’s book!
In 1998, Peter Zelchenko
began a project for VolumeOne Publishing: to create an
exact digital replica of Lewis
Carroll’s first edition of Alice.
Working with the original
1865 edition and numerous
other editions at the Newberry
Library in Chicago, Zelchenko
created a digital masterpiece in
his own right, a testament to
the original work of Lewis
Carroll (aka Prof. Charles
Dodgson) who personally
directed the typography for the
first Alice.
After much analyis, Peter then
painstakingly matched letter to
letter, line to line, of his new
digital edition to that of the
original. After weeks of toil he
created an exact replica of the
original! The book was added
to VolumeOne’s print-ondemand offering. While a PDF
version is offered on various
portals of the Net, BookVirtual
took the project to heart and
added its interface designs and
programming. Welcome to the
world’s most precise all-digital
replica of the world’s most
famous children’s book. Thank
you, Peter.

All in the golden afternoon
Full leisurely we glide;
For both our oars, with little skill,
By little arms are plied,
While little hands make vain pretence
Our wanderings to guide.
Ah, cruel Three! In such an hour,
Beneath such dreamy weather,
To beg a tale of breath too weak
To stir the tiniest feather!
Yet what can one poor voice avail
Against three tongues together?

Thus grew the tale of Wonderland :
Thus slowly, one by one,
Its quaint events were hammered out—
And now the tale is done,
And home we steer, a merry crew,
Beneath the setting sun.
Alice! a childish story take,
And with a gentle hand
Lay it where Childhood’s dreams are twined
In Memory’s mystic band,
Like pilgrim’s withered wreath of flowers
Plucked in a far-off land.
Imperious Prima flashes forth
Her edict ‘to begin it’—
In gentler tone Secunda hopes
‘There will be nonsense in it!’—
While Tertia interrupts the tale
Not more than once a minute.
Anon, to sudden silence won,
In fancy they pursue
The dream-child moving through a land
Of wonders wild and new,
In friendly chat with bird or beast—
And half believe it true.
And ever, as the story drained
The wells of fancy dry,
And faintly strove that weary one
To put the subject by,
“The rest next time—” “It is next time!”
The happy voices cry.

CHAPTER I.
DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE.
ALICE was beginning to get very tired of
sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having
nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, “ and what is

burning with curiosity, she ran across the field
after it, and was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after
it, never once considering how in the world
she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a
tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment
to think about stopping herself before she found
herself falling down what seemed to be a very
deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell
very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she
went down to look about her, and to wonder
what was going to happen next. First, she tried
to look down and make out what she was
coming to, but it was too dark to see anything :
then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards
and bookshelves: here and there she saw maps
and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down
the use of a book,” thought Alice, “ without
pictures or conversations ?”
So she was considering in her own mind,
(as well as she could, for the hot day made
her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the
pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be
worth the trouble of getting up and picking
the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with
pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in
that; nor did Alice think it so very much out
of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself,
“ Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered
at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at
it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,

her, still it was good practice to say it over)
“ —yes, that ’s about the right distance—but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude
I ’ve got to ?” (Alice had not the slightest
idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but
she thought they were nice grand words to say.)
Presently she began again. “ I wonder if
I shall fall right through the earth! How funny
it’ll seem to come out among the people that
walk with their heads downwards ! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather glad there
was no one listening, this time, as it didn ’t
sound at all the right word) “ —but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country
is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New
Zealand or Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey
as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling
through the air ! Do you think you could
manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl
she’ll think me for asking ! No, it’ll never do
to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up
somewhere.”

a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it
was labelled “ ORANGE MARMALADE,” but
to her great disappointment it was empty: she did
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into
one of the cupboards as she fell past it.
“Well !” thought Alice to herself, “ after
such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
tumbling down stairs ! How brave they ’ll all
think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of
the house !” (Which was very likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall never
come to an end ? “ I wonder how many miles
I ’ve fallen by this time ?” she said aloud. “I
must be getting somewhere near the centre of
the earth. Let me see : that would be four
thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see,
Alice had learnt several things of this sort in
her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this
was not a very good opportunity for showing off
her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to
4 DOWN THE
Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book
Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up
on to her feet in a moment : she looked up,
but it was all dark overhead; before her was
another long passage, and the White Rabbit was
still in sight, hurrying down it. There was
not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like
the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as
it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers,
how late it ’s getting !” She was close behind
it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit
was no longer to be seen : she found herself in
a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of
lamps hanging from the roof.
There were doors all round the hall, but they
were all locked, and when Alice had been all
the way down one side and up the other, trying
every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing
on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first
idea was that this might belong to one of the
RABBIT-HOLE. 7
Navigate Control Internet Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. © 2000 All Rights Reserved.
Down, down, down. There was nothing else to
do, so Alice soon began talking again. “Dinah ’ll
miss me very much to-night, I should think !”
(Dinah was the cat.) “ I hope they’ll remember
her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah, my dear!
I wish you were down here with me ! There
are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you
might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse,
you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?”
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and
went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort
of way, “Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ?”
and sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you
see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it
didn’t much matter which way she put it. She
felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun
to dream that she was walking hand in hand
with Dinah, and was saying to her very
earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did
you ever eat a bat ?” when suddenly, thump !
thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks
and dry leaves, and the fall was over.
6 DOWN THE

flowers and those cool fountains, but she could
not even get her head though the doorway ;
“ and even if my head would go through,”
thought poor Alice, “ it would be of very little
use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I
could shut up like a telescope! I think I could,
if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so
many out-of-the-way things had happened lately
that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by
the little door, so she went back to the table,
half hoping she might find another key on it,
or at any rate a book of rules for shutting
people up like telescopes : this time she found
a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not
here before,” said Alice,) and tied round the
neck of the bottle was a paper label with the
words “ DRINK ME” beautifully printed on
it in large letters.
It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but
the wise little Alice was not going to do that

doors of the hall ; but alas ! either the locks
were too large, or the key was too small, but
at any rate it would not open any of them.
However, on the second time round, she came
upon a low
curtain she had
not noticed before, and behind it was
a little door
about fifteen
inches high :
she tried the
little golden
key in the
lock, and to her great delight it fitted !
Alice opened the door and found that it led
into a small passage, not much larger than a
rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall,
and wander about among those beds of bright

so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it
very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed
flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very
soon finished it off.

“What a curious feeling !” said Alice, “ I
must be shutting up like a telescope.”
And so it was indeed : she was now only
ten inches high, and her face brightened up
at the thought that she was now the right
size for going through the little door into that
lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a
few minutes to see if she was going to shrink
any further : she felt a little nervous about
this, “ for it might end, you know,” said Alice
to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a
candle. I wonder what I should be like then?”
And she tried to fancy what the flame of a
candle looks like after the candle is blown out,

in a hurry: “ no, I ’ll look first,” she said,
“ and see whether
it’s marked ‘poison’
or not:” for she had
read several nice
little stories about
children who had
got burnt, and eaten
up by wild beasts,
and other unpleasant
things, all because
they would not remember the simple
rules their friends
had taught them, such as, that a red-hot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long ; and
that if you cut your finger very deeply with
a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never
forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle
marked “ poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
However, this bottle was not marked “poison,”
10 DOWN THE
Fit Page Full Screen On/Off Close Book
in a game of croquet she was playing against
herself, for this curious child was very fond of
pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use
now,” thought poor Alice, “ to pretend to be two
people! Why, there ’s hardly enough of me left
to make one respectable person !”
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that
was lying under the table: she opened it, and
found in it a very small cake, on which the
words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in
currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “ and if
it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key ;
and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under the door; so either way I’ll get into the
garden, and I don’t care which happens !”
She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to
herself “Which way? Which way?” holding her
hand on the top of her head to feel which way
it was growing, and she was quite surprised
to find that she remained the same size : to be
sure, this is what generally happens when one
eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
RABBIT-HOLE. 13
Navigate Control Internet Digital Interface by BookVirtual Corp. U.S. Patent Pending. © 2000 All Rights Reserved.
for she could not remember ever having seen
such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more
happened, she decided on going into the garden
at once, but, alas for poor Alice! when she got
to the door, she found she had forgotten the
little golden key, and when she went back to
the table for it, she found she could not possibly
reach it: she could see it quite plainly through
the glass, and she tried her best to climb up
one of the legs of the table, but it was too
slippery, and when she had tired herself out
with trying, the poor little thing sat down
and cried.
“Come, there ’s no use in crying like that!”
said Alice to herself, rather sharply, “ I advise
you to leave off this minute !” She generally
gave herself very good advice, (though she
very seldom followed it,) and sometimes she
scolded herself so severely as to bring tears
into her eyes, and once she remembered trying
to box her own ears for having cheated herself

THE POOL OF TEARS.
“Curiouser and curiouser !” cried Alice
(she was so much surprised, that for the
moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English) ; “ now I ’m
opening out like the
largest telescope that
ever was! Good-bye,
feet !” (for when she
looked down at her
feet, they seemed to
be almost out of sight,
they were getting so
far off) “Oh, my poor
little feet, I wonder
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and
stupid for life to go on in the common way.
So she set to work, and very soon finished
off the cake.

who will put on your shoes and stockings for
you now, dears? I’m sure I shan’t be able! I
shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way
you can;—but I must be kind to them,” thought
Alice, “or perhaps they won ’t walk the way I
want to go ! Let me see : I ’ll give them a new
pair of boots every Christmas.”
And she went on planning to herself how she
would manage it. “They must go by the carrier,”
she thought; “ and how funny it’ll seem, sending
presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the
directions will look !
Alice’s Right Foot, Esq.,
Hearthrug,
near the Fender.
(with Alice’s love.)
Oh dear, what nonsense I ’m talking !”
Just at this moment her head struck against the
roof of the hall: in fact she was now rather more
than nine feet high, and she at once took up the
little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do,
lying down on one side, to look through into
the garden with one eye; but to get through
was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and
began to cry again.
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said
Alice, “ a great girl like you,” (she might well
say this,) “ to go on crying in this way! Stop
this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there
was a large pool all round her, about four inches
deep and reaching half down the hall.
After a time she heard a little pattering of
feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her
eyes to see what was coming. It was the White
Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair
of white kid gloves in one hand and a large
fan in the other : he came trotting along in a
great hurry, muttering to himself as he came,
“Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she
be savage if I ’ve kept her waiting !” Alice
felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help
C

18 THE POOL OF TEARS. 19

Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the
hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all
the time she went on talking : “ Dear, dear !
How queer everything is to-day ! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if
I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think:
was I the same when I got up this morning?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different. But if I ’m not the same, the next
question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that’s
the great puzzle !” And she began thinking over
all the children she knew, that were of the
same age as herself, to see if she could have
been changed for any of them.
“I’m sure I ’m not Ada,” she said, “ for her
hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t
go in ringlets at all ; and I ’m sure I can ’t be
Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little ! Besides, she’s
she, and I’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it
all is ! I ’ll try if I know all the things I used
to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,
of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her,
she began, in a low, timid voice, “ If you please,
sir——” The Rabbit started violently, dropped
the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried
away into the darkness as hard as he could go.

“ I ’m sure those are not the right words,”
said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears
again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after
all, and I shall have to go and live in that
poky little house, and have next to no toys to
play with, and oh ! ever so many lessons to
learn ! No, I ’ve made up my mind about it :
if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here ! It’ll be no
use their putting their heads down and saying,
‘Come up again, dear !’ I shall only look up
and say, ‘Who am I then ? Tell me that first,
and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come
up: if not, I ’ll stay down here till I ’m somebody else’—but, oh dear !” cried Alice with a
sudden burst of tears, “ I do wish they would
put their heads down! I am so very tired of
being all alone here !”
As she said this, she looked down at her
hands, and was surprised to see that she had
put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves
while she was talking. “How can I have done
that?” she thought. “ I must be growing small
and four times six is thirteen, and four times
seven is—oh dear! I shall never get to twenty
at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table
don’t signify : let’s try Geography. London is
the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of
Rome, and Rome—no, that’s all wrong, I ’m
certain! I must have been changed for Mabel !
I’ll try and say ‘How doth the little—’ ” and she
crossed her hands on her lap, as if she were
saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her
voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words
did not come the same as they used to do :—
“How doth the little crocodile
Improve his shining tail,
And pour the waters of the Nile
On every golden scale !
How cheerfully he seems to grin,
How neatly spreads his claws,
And welcome little fishes in
With gently smiling jaws !”

again.” She got up and went to the table to
measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly
as she could guess, she was now about two feet
high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she
soon found out that the cause of this was the
fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily,
just in time to save herself from shrinking away
altogether.
“That was a narrow escape !” said Alice, a
good deal frightened at the sudden change, but
very glad to find herself still in existence ; “ and
now for the garden !” and she ran with all
speed back to the little door : but, alas ! the
little door was shut again, and the little golden
key was lying on the glass table as before, “ and
things are worse than ever,” thought the poor
child, “for I never was so small as this before,
never! And I declare it ’s too bad, that it is !”
As she said these words her foot slipped,
and in another moment, splash! she was up to
her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that
she had somehow fallen into the sea, “ and in
that case I can go back by railway,” she said
to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once
in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English
coast you find a number of bathing machines
in the sea, some children digging in the sand
with wooden spades, then a row of lodging
houses, and behind them a railway station.)
However, she soon made out that she was in
the pool of tears which she had wept when she
was nine feet high.
“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice,
as she swam about, trying to find her way out.

“I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears ! That will be
a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything
is queer to-day.”
Just then she heard something splashing
about in the pool a little way off, and she swam
nearer to make out what it was : at first she
thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus,
but then she remembered how small she was
now, and she soon made out that it was only
a mouse, that had slipped in like herself.
“Would it be of any use, now,” thought
Alice, “to speak to this mouse ? Everything is
so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think
very likely it can talk : at any rate there ’s
no harm in trying.” So she began: “O Mouse,
do you know the way out of this pool ? I am
very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!”
(Alice thought this must be the right way of
speaking to a mouse: she had never done such
a thing before, but she remembered having seen
in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—
of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”)
The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively,
and seemed to her to wink with one of its
little eyes, but it said nothing.
“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,”
thought Alice; “I daresay it ’s a French mouse,
come over with William the Conqueror.” (For,
with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no
very clear notion how long ago anything had
happened.) So she began again : “Ou est ma
chatte ?” which was the first sentence in her
French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden
leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver
all over with fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon !”
cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the
poor animal’s feelings. “ I quite forgot you didn’t
like cats.”
“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill,
passionate voice. “Would you like cats if you
were me?”
“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone : “don’t be angry about it. And yet

I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I
think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could
only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,”
Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily
about in the pool, “ and she sits purring so
nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing
to nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice——oh, I beg your pardon !” cried Alice
again, for this time the Mouse was bristling
all over, and she felt certain it must be really
offended. “We won’t talk about her any more
if you ’d rather not.”
“We, indeed !” cried the Mouse, who was
trembling down to the end of his tail. “As if I
would talk on such a subject! Our family always
hated cats : nasty, low, vulgar things ! Don’t
let me hear the name again !”
“ I won’t indeed !” said Alice, in a great
hurry to change the subject of conversation.
“ Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs ?” The
mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:
“There is such a nice little dog near our house
I should like to show you ! A little brighteyed terrier, you know, with oh ! such long
curly brown hair! And it ’ll fetch things when
you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for
its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a
farmer, you know, and he says it’s so useful,
it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills
all the rats and—oh dear !” cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone. “ I ’m afraid I ’ve offended it

THE POOL OF TEARS.
CHAPTER III.
A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE.
THEY were indeed a queer-looking party that
assembled on the bank—the birds with draggled
feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close
to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
The first question of course was, how to get
dry again: they had a consultation about this,
again !” For the Mouse was swimming away
from her as hard as it could go, and making
quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
So she called softly after it: “Mouse dear!
Do come back again, and we won’t talk about
cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them !”
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round
and swam slowly back to her : its face was
quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and
it said in a low, trembling voice, “Let us get
to the shore, and then I ’ll tell you my history,
and you ’ll understand why it is I hate cats
and dogs.”
It was high time to go, for the pool was
getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there was a Duck
and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several
other curious creatures. Alice led the way,
and the whole party swam to the shore.

favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to
by the English, who wanted leaders, and had
been of late much accustomed to usurpation and
conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria—’ ”
“Ugh !” said the Lory, with a shiver.
“ I beg your pardon ?” said the Mouse,
frowning, but very politely : “Did you speak ?”
“Not I !” said the Lory, hastily.
“ I thought you did,” said the Mouse.—“ I
proceed. ‘ Edwin and Morcar, the earls of
Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him ;
and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of
Canterbury, found it advisable—”
“Found what?” said the Duck.
“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly:
“of course you know what ‘it’ means.”
“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when
I find a thing,” said the Duck : “it’s generally
a frog or a worm. The question is, what did
the archbishop find?”
The Mouse did not notice this question, but
and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
them, as if she had known them all her life.
Indeed, she had quite a long argument with
the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would
only say, “ I am older than you, and must know
better;” and this Alice would not allow, without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory
positively refused to tell its age, there was no
more to be said.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a
person of some authority among them, called
out, “Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
I’ll soon make you dry enough !” They all sat
down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse
in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously
fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a
bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.
“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important
air, “are you all ready ? This is the driest thing
I know. Silence all round, if you please !

had paused as if it thought that somebody ought
to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to
say anything.
“Why,” said the Dodo, “ the best way to
explain it is to do it.” (And as you might like
to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I
will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort
of circle, (“the exact shape doesn ’t matter,” it
said,) and then all the party were placed along
the course, here and there. There was no “One,
two, three, and away,” but they began running
when they liked, and left off when they liked, so
that it was not easy to know when the race was
over. However, when they had been running halfan-hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo
suddenly called out, “The race is over!” and they
all crowded round it, panting, and asking, “But
who has won ?”
This question the Dodo could not answer
without a great deal of thought, and it sat for
a long time with one finger pressed upon its
hurriedly went on, “ ‘—found it advisable to go
with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer
him the crown. William’s conduct at first was
moderate. But the insolence of his Normans—’
How are you getting on now, my dear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.
“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy
tone: “it doesn ’t seem to dry me at all.”
“ In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly,
rising to its feet, “ I move that the meeting
adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies—”
“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don ’t
know the meaning of half those long words,
and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!”
And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a
smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.
“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo
in an offended tone, “was, that the best thing
to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”
“What is a Caucus-race ?” said Alice ; not
that she much wanted to know, but the Dodo

forehead, (the position in which you usually
see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him,) while
the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,
“Everybody has won, and all must have prizes.”
“ But who is to give the prizes ?” quite a
chorus of voices asked.
“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole
party at once crowded round her, calling out in
a confused way, “Prizes! Prizes !”
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair
she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled
out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it,) and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one a-piece, all round.
“ But she must have a prize herself, you
know,” said the Mouse.
“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely.
“What else have you got in your pocket?” he
went on, turning to Alice.
“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.
“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.
Then they all crowded round her once more,
while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble,
saying, “We beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimble;” and, when it had finished this short
speech, they all cheered.

so that her idea of the tale was something like
this:——“Fury said to
a mouse, That
he met
in the
house,
‘Let us
both go
to law :
I will
prosecute
you.—
Come, I ’ll
take no
denial ;
We must
have a
trial :
For
really
this
morning
I ’ve
nothing
to do.’ Said the
mouse to
the cur,
‘ Such a
trial,
dear sir,
With no jury or
judge,
would be wasting our breath.’ ‘I ’ll be
judge,
I ’ll be
jury,’
Said
cunning
old Fury;
‘I ’ll try
the whole
cause,
and
condemn
you
to
death.’”
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd,
but they all looked so grave that she did not
dare to laugh, and as she could not think of
anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the
thimble, looking as solemn as she could.
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this
caused some noise and confusion, as the large
birds complained that they could not taste theirs,
and the small ones choked and had to be patted
on the back. However it was over at last, and
they sat down again in a ring, and begged the
Mouse to tell them something more.
“You promised to tell me your history, you
know,” said Alice, “ and why it is you hate—C
and D,” she added in a whisper, half afraid that
it would be offended again.
“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the
Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.
“ It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice,
looking down with wonder at the Mouse’s tail ;
“but why do you call it sad ?” And she kept on
puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,

and an old crab took the opportunity of saying
to her daughter, “ Ah, my dear ! Let this be
a lesson to you never to lose your temper !”
“Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the young crab,
a little snappishly. “ You ’re enough to try
the patience of an oyster !”
“ I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I
do !” said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in
particular. “She’d soon fetch it back !”
“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to
ask the question ?” said the Lory.
Alice replied eagerly, for she was always
ready to talk about her pet. “ Dinah ’s our
cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching
mice you can ’t think ! And oh, I wish you
could see her after the birds! Why, she ’ll eat
a little bird as soon as look at it !”
This speech caused a remarkable sensation
among the party. Some of the birds hurried
off at once : one old magpie began wrapping
itself up very carefully, remarking, “ I really
must be getting home ; the night-air doesn ’t
“ You are not attending !” said the Mouse
to Alice, severely. “What are you thinking of?”
“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly:
“you had got to the fifth bend, I think ?”
“ I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and
very angrily.
“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make
herself useful, and looking anxiously about her.
“Oh, do let me help to undo it !”
“ I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the
Mouse, getting up and walking away. “You
insult me by talking such nonsense !”
“ I didn ’t mean it !” pleaded poor Alice.
“But you ’re so easily offended, you know !”
The Mouse only growled in reply.
“Please come back, and finish your story!”
Alice called after it; and the others all joined
in chorus, “ Yes, please do !” but the Mouse
only shook its head impatiently, and walked a
little quicker.
“What a pity it wouldn ’t stay !” sighed
the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight ;

A CAUCUS-RACE AND A LONG TALE.
CHAPTER IV.
THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL.
IT was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly
back again, and looking anxiously about as it
went, as if it had lost something ; and she heard
it muttering to itself, “The Duchess ! The
Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and
whiskers ! She ’ll get me executed, as sure as
ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped
them, I wonder!” Alice guessed in a moment
that it was looking for the fan and the pair
of white kid gloves, and she very goodnaturedly
began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have
suit my throat!” and a canary called out in a
trembling voice to its children, “Come away, my
dears! It’s high time you were all in bed !” On
various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice
was soon left alone.
“ I wish I hadn ’t mentioned Dinah !” she
said to herself in a melancholy tone. “Nobody
seems to like her, down here, and I ’m sure she’s
the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah!
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!”
And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she
felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little
while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked
up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had
changed his mind, and was coming back to
finish his story.

42 THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL. 43
turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.
“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself,
“to be going messages for a rabbit ! I suppose
Dinah ’ll be sending me on messages next !”
And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen : “ ‘Miss Alice ! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk !’ ‘Coming
in a minute, nurse ! But I ’ve got to watch
this mousehole till Dinah comes back, and see
that the mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t
think,” Alice went on, “ that they’d let Dinah
stop in the house if it began ordering people
about like that !”
By this time she had found her way into
a tidy little room with a table in the window,
and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or
three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took
up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was
just going to leave the room, when her eye fell
upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass. There was no label this time with the
changed since her swim in the pool, and the
great hall, with the glass table and the little
door, had vanished completely.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she
went hunting about, and called out to her in
an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you
doing out here? Run home this moment, and
fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick,
now!” And Alice was so much frightened that
she ran off at once in the direction it pointed
to, without trying to explain the mistake that
it had made.
“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to
herself as she ran. “ How surprised he ’ll be
when he finds out who I am! But I’d better
take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can
find them.” As she said this, she came upon a
neat little house, on the door of which was a
bright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,”
engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest
she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be

44 THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL. 45
words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “ I know
something interesting is sure to happen,” she
said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I ’ll just see what this bottle does.
I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for
really I ’m quite tired of being such a tiny
little thing !”
It did so indeed, and much sooner than she
had expected : before she had drunk half the
bottle, she found her head pressing against the
ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from
being broken. She hastily put down the bottle,
saying to herself, “That ’s quite enough—I hope
I shan’t grow any more—As it is, I can’t get
out at the door—I do wish I hadn ’t drunk
quite so much !”
Alas ! It was too late to wish that ! She
went on growing and growing, and very soon
had to kneel down on the floor : in another
minute there was not even room for this, and
she tried the effect of lying down with one
elbow against the door, and the other arm
curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm
out of the window, and one foot up the chimney,
and said to herself, “Now I can do no more,
whatever happens. What will become of me ?”
Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had
now had its full effect, and she grew no larger:
still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there
seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever

“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can you learn lessons in here ? Why,
there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all
for any lesson-books !”
And so she went on, taking first one side and
then the other, and making quite a conversation
of it altogether, but after a few minutes she
heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.
“ Mary Ann ! Mary Ann !” said the voice,
“fetch me my gloves this moment !” Then came
a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice
knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her,
and she trembled till she shook the house, quite
forgetting that she was now about a thousand
times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason
to be afraid of it.
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door,
and tried to open it, but as the door opened
inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard
against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice
heard it say to itself, “Then I’ll go round and
get in at the window.”
getting out of the room again, no wonder she
felt unhappy.
“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought
poor Alice, “when one wasn ’t always growing
larger and smaller, and being ordered about by
mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn ’t gone
down that rabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it ’s
rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I
do wonder what can have happened to me !
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that
kind of thing never happened, and now here I
am in the middle of one ! There ought to be
a book written about me, that there ought !
And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’m
grown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone,
“at least there’s no room to grow up any more
here.”
“ But then,” thought Alice, “ shall I never
get any older than I am now ? That ’ll be a
comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—
but then—always to have lessons to learn ! Oh,
I shouldn ’t like that!”

out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)
“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”
“ Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour !” (He pronounced it “ arrum.”)
“ An arm, you goose ! Who ever saw one
that size ? Why, it fills the whole window !”
“Sure, it does, yer honour : but it ’s an arm
for all that.”
“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate:
go and take it away !”
There was a long silence after this, and Alice
could only hear whispers now and then, such
as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at
all !” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at
last she spread out her hand again and made
another snatch in the air. This time there were
two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken
glass. “What a number of cucumber frames
there must be !” thought Alice. “ I wonder
what they ’ll do next ! As for pulling me out
of the window, I only wish they could ! I ’m
sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer !”
“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after
waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit
just under the window, she suddenly spread
out her hand, and
made a snatch in the
air. She did not get
hold of anything, but
she heard a little
shriek and a fall,
and a crash of broken glass, from which
she concluded that
it was just possible
it had fallen into a
cucumber-frame, or
something of the sort.
Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—
“Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ?” And then a
voice she had never heard before, “Sure then
I’m here ! Digging for apples, yer honour !”
“ Digging for apples, indeed !” said the
Rabbit angrily. “ Here ! Come and help me

She waited for some time without hearing
anything more : at last came a rumbling of
little cart-wheels, and the sound of a good many
voices all talking together : she made out the
words, “Where ’s the other ladder ?—Why, I
hadn’t to bring but one : Bill ’s got the other—
Bill ! fetch it here, lad !—Here, put ’em up at
this corner—No, tie ’em together first—they
don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh! they’ll
do well enough ; don ’t be particular—Here,
Bill ! catch hold of this rope—Will the roof
bear ?—Mind that loose slate—Oh, it ’s coming
down ! Heads below !” (a loud crash)—“Now,
who did that ?—It was Bill, I fancy—Who ’s
to go down the chimney ?—Nay, I shan ’t !
You do it !—That I won ’t then !—Bill ’s got
to go down—Here, Bill! the master says you ’ve
got to go down the chimney !”
“Oh, so Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he ?” said Alice to herself. “Why,
they seem to put everything upon Bill ! I
wouldn ’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal :
this fireplace is narrow,
to be sure, but I think
I can kick a little !”
She drew her foot as
far down the chimney as
she could, and waited till
she heard a little animal
(she couldn ’t guess of
what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about
in the chimney close above
her : then, saying to herself, “This is Bill,” she
gave one sharp kick, and
waited to see what would
happen next.
The first thing she
heard was a general
chorus of “There goes
Bill !” then the Rabbit’s
voice alone—“Catch him,
you by the hedge !” then

a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at
the window, and some of them hit her in the
face. “ I’ll put a stop to this,” she said to herself
and shouted out, “ You ’d better not do that
again!” which produced another dead silence.
Alice noticed with some surprise that the
pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they
lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into
her head. “ If I eat one of these cakes,” she
thought, “ it’s sure to make some change in my
size; and as it can ’t possibly make me larger,
it must make me smaller, I suppose.”
So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was
delighted to find that she began shrinking
directly. As soon as she was small enough to
get through the door, she ran out of the house,
and found quite a crowd of little animals and
birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard,
Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two
guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out
of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the
moment she appeared, but she ran off as hard
silence, and then another confusion of voices—
“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don ’t choke
him—How was it, old fellow? What happened
to you ? Tell us all about it !”
Last came a little feeble squeaking voice,
(“That’s Bill,” thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly
know—No more, thank ’ye, I ’m better now—
but I ’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all
I know is, something comes at me like a Jackin-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket !”
“So you did, old fellow !” said the others.
“We must burn the house down !” said the
Rabbit’s voice, and Alice called out as loud as
she could, “If you do, I ’ll set Dinah at you !”
There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice
thought to herself, “ I wonder what they will
do next ! If they had any sense, they’d take
the roof off.” After a minute or two they
began moving about again, and Alice heard the
Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”
“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but
she had not long to doubt, for the next moment

as she could, and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood.
“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice
to herself, as she wandered about in the wood,
“ is to grow to my right size again ; and the
second thing is to find my way into that lovely
garden. I think that will be the best plan.”
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and
very neatly and simply arranged ; the only
difficulty was, that she had not the smallest
idea how to set about it ; and while she was
peering about anxiously among the trees, a
little sharp bark just over her head made her
look up in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at
her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching
out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little
thing!” said Alice in a coaxing tone, and she
tried hard to whistle to it, but she was terribly
frightened all the time at the thought that it
might be hungry, in which case it would be very
likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up
a little bit of stick, and held it out to the
puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the
air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of

56 THE RABBIT SENDS IN A LITTLE BILL. 57
“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!”
said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to
rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the
leaves, “ I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much, if—if I’d only been the right size
to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that
I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how
is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat
or drink something or other ; but the great
question is, what ?”
The great question certainly was, what ?
Alice looked all round her at the flowers and
the blades of grass, but she could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat
or drink under the circumstances. There was a
large mushroom growing near her, about the
same height as herself, and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind
it, it occurred to her that she might as well
look and see what was on the top of it.
She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and
peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her
delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a
great thistle, to keep herself from being run
over, and, the moment she appeared on the
other side, the puppy made another rush at the
stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry
to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was
very like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again ;
then the puppy began a series of short charges
at the stick, running a very little way forwards
each time and a long way back, and barking
hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down
a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half
shut.
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for
making her escape, so she set off at once, and
ran till she was quite tired and out of breath,
and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint
in the distance.

CHAPTER V.
ADVICE FROM A CATERPILLAR.
THE Caterpillar and Alice looked at each
other for some time in silence : at last the
Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth,
eyes immediately met those of a large blue
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its
arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and
taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.

you’ll feel it a little queer, won’t you ?”
“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice; “all I know is, it would feel
very queer to me.”
“You !” said the Caterpillar contemptuously.
“Who are you ?”
Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little
irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very
short remarks, and she drew herself up and
said, very gravely, “I think, you ought to tell
me who you are, first.”
“Why?” said the Caterpillar.
Here was another puzzling question ; and, as
Alice could not think of any good reason, and
as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.
“ Come back !” the Caterpillar called after
her. “I’ve something important to say !”
This sounded promising, certainly : Alice
turned and came back again.
and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.
“Who are you ?” said the Caterpillar.
This was not an encouraging opening for a
conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, “ I—I
hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I
know who I was when I got up this morning,
but I think I must have been changed several
times since then.”
“What do you mean by that ?” said the
Caterpillar sternly. “Explain yourself !”
“ I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,”
said Alice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”
“I don ’t see,” said the Caterpillar.
“ I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,”
Alice replied very politely, “for I can ’t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so
many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”
“It isn ’t,” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,”
said Alice; “but when you have to turn into a
chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and
then after that into a butterfly, I should think

“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.
“ Is that all ?” said Alice, swallowing down
her anger as well as she could.
“No,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice thought she might as well wait, as
she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after
all it might tell her something worth hearing.
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the
hookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So
you think you’re changed, do you ?”
“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’t
remember things as I used—and I don’t keep
the same size for ten minutes together !”
“ Can’t remember what things ?” said the
Caterpillar.
“Well, I’ve tried to say ‘How doth the
little busy bee,’ but it all came different !”
Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.
“ Repeat ‘You are old, Father William,’ ”
said the Caterpillar.
Alice folded her hands, and began :—
“You are old, father William,” the young man said,
“And your hair has become very white;
And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
Do you think, at your age, it is right ?”
“ In my youth,” father William replied to his son,
“ I feared it might injure the brain;
But now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,
Why, I do it again and again.”

“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet;
Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—
Pray, how did you manage to do it ?”
“ In my youth,” said his father, “ I took to the law,
And argued each case with my wife;
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
Has lasted the rest of my life.”
“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,
And have grown most uncommonly fat ;
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
Pray, what is the reason of that ?”

By the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—

“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.
“ Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice
timidly; “some of the words have got altered.”
“ It is wrong from beginning to end,” said
the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence
for some minutes.
The Caterpillar was the first to speak.
“What size do you want to be ?” it asked.
“ Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice
hastily replied; “only one doesn’t like changing
so often, you know.”
“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.
Alice said nothing : she had never been so
much contradicted in her life before, and she
felt that she was losing her temper.
“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.
“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir,
if you wouldn’t mind,” said Alice : “ three inches
is such a wretched height to be.”
“It is a very good height indeed !” said the
Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it
spoke (it was exactly three inches high).
“You are old,” said the youth ; “ one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever ;
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
What made you so awfully clever ?”
“ I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”
Said his father; “ don’t give yourself airs !

which were the two sides of it ; and, as it was
perfectly round, she found this a very difficult
question. However, at last she stretched her
arms round it as far as they would go, and
broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.
“And now which is which ?” she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to
try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck
her foot!
She was a good deal frightened by this very
sudden change, but she felt that there was no
time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly ;
so she set to work at once to eat some of the
other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely
against her foot, that there was hardly room to
open her mouth ; but she did it at last, and
managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand
bit.

“ But I’m not used to it !” pleaded poor
Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought to
herself, “ I wish the creatures wouldn’t be so
easily offended !”
“ You ’ll get used to it in time,” said the
Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its
mouth and began smoking again.
This time Alice waited patiently until it
chose to speak again. In a minute or two the
Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth,
and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.
Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled
away into the grass, merely remarking as it
went, “ One side will make you grow taller,
and the other side will make you grow shorter.”
“ One side of what ? The other side of
what?” thought Alice to herself.
“ Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar,
just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in
another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the
mushroom for a minute, trying to make out

trees under which she had been wandering,
when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face,
and was beating her violently with its wings.
“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.
“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly.
“Let me alone !”
“Serpent, I say again !” repeated the Pigeon,
but in a more subdued tone, and added with
a kind of sob, “ I’ve tried every way, and
nothing seems to suit them !”
“I haven ’t the least idea what you’re talking about,” said Alice.
“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried
banks, and I’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went
on, without attending to her ; “ but those
serpents! There’s no pleasing them !”
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she
thought there was no use in saying anything
more till the Pigeon had finished.
“ As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching
the eggs,” said the Pigeon; “but I must be on
“Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in
a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in
another moment, when she found that her
shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she
could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise
like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that
lay far below her.
“What can all that green stuff be ?” said
Alice. “And where have my shoulders got to?
And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see
you ?” She was moving them about as she
spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a
little shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be no chance of getting
her hands up to her head, she tried to get her
head down to them, and was delighted to find
that her neck would bend about easily in any
direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded
in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and
was going to dive in among the leaves, which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the

serpent; and there ’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never
tasted an egg !”
“ I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice,
who was a very truthful child ; “but little girls
eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you
know.”
“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if
they do, why then they’re a kind of serpent,
that’s all I can say.”
This was such a new idea to Alice, that
she was quite silent for a minute or two, which
gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding,
“ You ’re looking for eggs, I know that well
enough ; and what does it matter to me
whether you ’re a little girl or a serpent ?”
“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice
hastily ; “ but I ’m not looking for eggs, as it
happens; and if I was, I shouldn ’t want yours :
I don’t like them raw.”
“Well, be off, then !” said the Pigeon in a
sulky tone, as it settled down again into its
the look-out for serpents night and day! Why,
I haven ’t had a wink of sleep these three
weeks!”
“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said
Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.
“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in
the wood,” continued the Pigeon, raising its
voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking
I should be free of them at last, they must
needs come wriggling down from the sky !
Ugh! Serpent!”
“ But I ’m not a serpent, I tell you !” said
Alice. “I ’m a—— I ’m a——”
“Well ! What are you ?” said the Pigeon.
“I can see you ’re trying to invent something !”
“ I—I ’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather
doubtfully, as she remembered the number of
changes she had gone through that day.
“A likely story indeed !” said the Pigeon in
a tone of the deepest contempt. “ I ’ve seen a
good many little girls in my time, but never one
with such a neck as that ! No, no! You ’re a

nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as
well as she could, for her neck kept getting
entangled among the branches, and every now
and then she had to stop and untwist it.
After a while she remembered that she still
held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and
she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at
one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she
had succeeded in bringing herself down to her
usual height.
It was so long since she had been anything
near the right size, that it felt quite strange
at first, but she got used to it in a few
minutes, and began talking to herself as usual.
“Come, there ’s half my plan done now! How
puzzling all these changes are ! I’m never sure
what I ’m going to be, from one minute to
another! However, I’ve got back to my right
size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon
an open place, with a little house in it about
four feet high. “Whoever lives there,” thought
Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them this
size: why, I should frighten them out of their
wits!” So she began nibbling at the right-hand
bit again, and did not venture to go near the
house till she had brought herself down to nine
inches high.

to know what it was all about, and crept a
little way out of the wood to listen.
The Fish-Footman began by producing from
under his arm a great letter, nearly as large
as himself, and this he handed over to the
other, saying in a solemn tone, “For the

FOR a minute or two she stood looking at
the house, and wondering what to do next,
when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood—(she considered him to
be a footman because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only, she would
have called him a fish)—and rapped loudly at
the door with his knuckles. It was opened by
another footman in livery, with a round face
and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen,
Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled
all over their heads. She felt very curious

crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to
pieces.
“Please, then,” said Alice, “ how am I to
get in ?”
“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went on without attending
to her, “if we had the door between us. For
instance, if you were inside, you might knock,
and I could let you out, you know.” He was
looking up into the sky all the time he was
speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly
uncivil. “ But perhaps he can’t help it,” she
said to herself ; “ his eyes are so very nearly
at the top of his head. But at any rate he
might answer questions—How am I to get
in?” she repeated, aloud.
“ I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked,
“till to-morrow——”
At this moment the door of the house
opened, and a large plate came skimming out,
straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed
his nose, and broke to pieces against one of
croquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the
same solemn tone, only changing the order of
the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.”
Then they both bowed low, and their curls
got entangled together.
Alice laughed so much at this that she had
to run back into the wood for fear of their
hearing her, and when she next peeped out the
Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting
on the ground near the door, staring stupidly
up into the sky.
Alice went timidly up to the door, and
knocked.
“There ’s no sort of use in knocking,” said
the Footman, “ and that for two reasons. First,
because I ’m on the same side of the door as
you are; secondly, because they’re making such a
noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.”
And certainly there was a most extraordinary
noise going on within—a constant howling
and sneezing, and every now and then a great

the trees behind him.
“——or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing
had happened.
“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again in
a louder tone.
“Are you to get in at all ?” said the Footman. “That’s the first question, you know.”
It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to
be told so. “It’s really dreadful,” she muttered
to herself, “ the way all the creatures argue.
It’s enough to drive one crazy !”
The Footman seemed to think this a good
opportunity for repeating his remark, with
variations. “ I shall sit here,” he said, “on and
off, for days and days.”
“But what am I to do?” said Alice.
“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and
began whistling.
“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said
Alice desperately : “he’s perfectly idiotic !” And
she opened the door and went in.
The door led right into a large kitchen,
which was full of smoke from one end to the
other : the Duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle, nursing a baby ; the
cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large
cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.
“There’s certainly too much pepper in that
soup !” Alice said to herself, as well as she
could for sneezing.

“They all can,” said the Duchess ; “ and
most of ’em do.”
“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said
very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got
into a conversation.
“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess ;
“and that’s a fact.”
Alice did not at all like the tone of this
remark, and thought it would be as well to
introduce some other subject of conversation.
While she was trying to fix on one, the cook
took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at
once set to work throwing everything within
her reach at the Duchess and the baby—the
fire-irons came first ; then followed a shower
of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess
took no notice of them even when they hit her;
and the baby was howling so much already, that
it was quite impossible to say whether the
blows hurt it or not.
“Oh, please mind what you ’re doing !” cried
Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of
There was certainly too much of it in the
air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ;
and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment’s pause. The
only two creatures in the kitchen that did not
sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was
sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to
ear.
“Please, would you tell me,” said Alice, a
little timidly, for she was not quite sure
whether it was good manners for her to speak
first, “why your cat grins like that ?”
“ It ’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess,
“and that’s why. Pig !”
She said the last word with such sudden
violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw
in another moment that it was addressed to
the baby, and not to her, so she took courage,
and went on again :—
“ I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always
grinned; in fact, I didn’t know that cats could
grin.”

terror. “Oh, there goes his precious nose !” as
an unusually large saucepan flew close by it,
and very nearly carried it off.
“ If everybody minded their own business,”
said the Duchess in a hoarse growl, “the world
would go round a deal faster than it does.”
“Which would not be an advantage,” said
Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity
of showing off a little of her knowledge. “Just
think of what work it would make with the day
and night ! You see the earth takes twenty-four
hours to turn round on its axis——”
“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “ chop
off her head !”
Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook,
to see if she meant to take the hint; but the
cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not
to be listening, so she went on again : “Twentyfour hours, I think; or is it twelve ? I——”
“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess ; “I
never could abide figures.” And with that she
began nursing her child again, singing a sort of
lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line :—
“Speak roughly to your little boy,
And beat him when he sneezes;
He only does it to annoy,
Because he knows it teases.”
CHORUS
(in which the cook and the baby joined) :—
“Wow! wow! wow !”
While the Duchess sang the second verse of
the song, she kept tossing the baby violently up
and down, and the poor little thing howled so,
that Alice could hardly hear the words :—
“ I speak severely to my boy,
I beat him when he sneezes ;
For he can thoroughly enjoy
The pepper when he pleases!”

“Wow! wow! wow !”

or two : wouldn’t it be murder to leave it
behind?” She said the last words out loud, and
the little thing grunted in reply (it had left off
sneezing by this time). “ Don’t grunt,” said
Alice : “ that ’s not at all a proper way of
expressing yourself.”
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked
very anxiously into its face to see what was the
matter with it. There could be no doubt that
it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a
snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were
getting extremely small, for a baby : altogether
Alice did not like the look of the thing at all,
“ —but perhaps it was only sobbing,” she
thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see
if there were any tears.
No, there were no tears. “ If you’re going to
turn into a pig, my dear,” said Alice, seriously,
“I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind
now !” The poor little thing sobbed again, (or
grunted, it was impossible to say which,) and
they went on for some while in silence.
“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like !”
said the Duchess to Alice, flinging the baby at
her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready to
play croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried
out of the room. The cook threw a fryingpan
after her as she went, but it just missed her.
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty,
as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held
out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like
a star-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing
was snorting like a steam-engine when she
caught it, and kept doubling itself up and
straightening itself out again, so that altogether,
for the first minute or two, it was as much as
she could do to hold it.
As soon as she had made out the proper way
of nursing it, (which was to twist it up into a
sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its
right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open
air. “ If I don’t take this child away with me,”
thought Alice, “ they’re sure to kill it in a day

might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “if one only knew the right way
to change them——” when she was a little
startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on
a bough of a tree a few yards off.
The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.
It looked goodnatured, she thought : still it
had very long claws and a great many teeth,
so she felt it ought to be treated with respect.
“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly,
as she did not at all know whether it would
like the name : however, it only grinned a little
wider. “ Come, it ’s pleased so far,” thought
Alice, and she went on, “Would you tell me,
please, which way I ought to walk from here ?”
“That depends a good deal on where you
want to get to,” said the Cat.
“I don ’t much care where——” said Alice.
“Then it doesn’t matter which way you
walk,” said the Cat.
“ ——so long as I get somewhere,” Alice
added as an explanation.
Alice was just beginning to think to herself,
“ Now, what am I to do with this creature
when I get it home ?” when it grunted again,
so violently, that she
looked down into its
face in some alarm.
This time there could
be no mistake about
it : it was neither
more nor less than
a pig, and she felt
that it would be
quite absurd for her
to carry it any further.
So she set the
little creature down, and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood. “ If
it had grown up,” she said to herself, “it would
have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes
rather a handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children she knew, who

“Well, then,” the Cat
went on, “you see a dog
growls when it ’s angry,
and wags its tail when it ’s
pleased. Now I growl when
I’m pleased, and wag my
tail when I’m angry. Therefore I ’m mad.”
“ I call it purring, not
growling,” said Alice.
“Call it what you like,”
said the Cat. “ Do you
“Oh, you ’re sure to do that,” said the Cat,
“if you only walk long enough.”
Alice felt that this could not be denied, so
she tried another question. “What sort of
people live about here ?”
“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its
right paw round, “ lives a Hatter : and in that
direction,” waving the other paw, “lives a March
Hare. Visit either you like : they ’re both mad.”
“ But I don’t want to go among mad
people,” Alice remarked.
“ Oh, you can ’t help that,” said the Cat :
“we’re all mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”
“How do you know I ’m mad ?” said Alice.
“ You must be,” said the Cat, “ or you
wouldn’t have come here.”
Alice didn ’t think that proved it at all ;
however, she went on: “And how do you know
that you’re mad ?”
“To begin with,” said the Cat, “ a dog ’s not
mad. You grant that ?”
“I suppose so,” said Alice.

play croquet with the Queen to day ?”
“ I should like it very much,” said Alice,
“but I haven’t been invited yet.”
“ You ’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and
vanished.
Alice was not much surprised at this, she
was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.
“ By-the-bye, what became of the baby ?”
said the Cat. “I ’d nearly forgotten to ask.”
“It turned into a pig,” Alice answered very
quietly, just as if the Cat had come back in a
natural way.
“ I thought it would,” said the Cat, and
vanished again.
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it
again, but it did not appear, and after a minute
or two she walked on in the direction in which
the March Hare was said to live. “ I ’ve seen
hatters before,” she said to herself: ”the March
Hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—
at least not so mad as it was in March.” As
she said this, she looked up, and there was the
Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.
“Did you say pig, or fig ?” said the Cat.
“I said pig,” replied Alice; “ and I wish you
wouldn’t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”
“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it
vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of
the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

CHAPTER VII.
A MAD TEA-PARTY.
THERE was a table set out under a tree in
front of the house, and the March Hare and the
Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was
sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other
two were using it as a cushion, resting their
elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very
uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice;
“only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”
The table was a large one, but the three
were all crowded together at one corner of it:
“ No room ! No room !” they cried out when
they saw Alice coming. “There ’s plenty of
“Well ! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,”
thought Alice ; “ but a grin without a cat !
It’ s the most curious thing I ever saw in all
my life !”
She had not gone much farther before she
came in sight of the house of the March Hare:
she thought it must be the right house, because
the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof
was thatched with fur. It was so large a house,
that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high :
even then she walked up towards it rather
timidly, saying to herself, “ Suppose it should
be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone
to see the Hatter instead !”

room!” said Alice indignantly, and she sat down
in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.
“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in
an encouraging tone.
Alice looked all round the table, but there
was nothing on it but tea. “ I don ’t see any
wine,” she remarked.
“There isn ’t any,” said the March Hare.
“Then it wasn ’t very civil of you to offer
it,” said Alice angrily.
“ It wasn ’t very civil of you to sit down
without being invited,” said the March Hare.
“ I didn ’t know it was your table,” said
Alice ; “ it ’s laid for a great many more than
three.”
“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter.
He had been looking at Alice for some time
with great curiosity, and this was his first
speech.
“ You should learn not to make personal
remarks,” Alice said with some severity : “ it ’s
very rude.”
The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on
hearing this; but all he said was, “Why is a
raven like a writing-desk ?”
“ Come, we shall have some fun now !”
thought Alice. “I ’m glad they’ve begun asking riddles—I believe I can guess that,” she
added aloud.
“Do you mean that you think you can find
out the answer to it ?” said the March Hare.
“Exactly so,” said Alice.
“Then you should say what you mean,” the

ing to Alice : he had taken his watch out of
his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to
his ear.
Alice considered a little, and said, “The
fourth.”
“Two days wrong !” sighed the Hatter. “ I
told you butter wouldn ’t suit the works !” he
added, looking angrily at the March Hare.
“ It was the best butter,” the March Hare
meekly replied.
“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in
as well,” the Hatter grumbled: “you shouldn ’t
have put it in with the bread-knife.”
The March Hare took the watch and looked
at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup
of tea, and looked at it again : but he could
think of nothing better to say than his first
remark, “ It was the best butter, you know.”
Alice had been looking over his shoulder with
some curiosity. “What a funny watch !” she
remarked. “ It tells the day of the month, and
March Hare went on.
“ I do,” Alice hastily replied ; “ at least—at
least I mean what I say—that ’s the same thing,
you know.”
“Not the same thing a bit !” said the Hatter.
“Why, you might just as well say that ‘ I see
what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘ I eat what I
see’!”
“ You might just as well say,” added the
March Hare, “ that ‘ I like what I get’ is the
same thing as ‘ I get what I like’ !”
“ You might just as well say,” added the
Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his
sleep, “that ‘ I breathe when I sleep’ is the same
thing as ‘ I sleep when I breathe’ !”
“ It is the same thing with you,” said the
Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and
the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice
thought over all she could remember about
ravens and writing-desks, which wasn ’t much.
The Hatter was the first to break the silence.
“What day of the month is it?” he said, turnH 2

“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what ’s
the answer ?”
“ I haven ’t the slightest idea,” said the
Hatter.
“Nor I,” said the March Hare.
Alice sighed wearily. “ I think you might
do something better with the time,” she said,
“ than waste it in asking riddles that have
no answers.”
“ If you knew Time as well as I do,” said
the Hatter, “you wouldn’t talk about wasting
it. It’s him.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.
“ Of course you don’t !” the Hatter said,
tossing his head contemptuously. “I dare say
you never even spoke to Time !”
“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but
I know I have to beat time when I learn
music.”
“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter.
“ He won’t stand beating. Now, if you only
kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost
doesn’t tell what o’clock it is !”
“Why should it ?” muttered the Hatter.
“Does your watch tell you what year it is ?”
“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily :
“but that ’s because it stays the same year for
such a long time together.”
“Which is just the case with mine,” said
the Hatter.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s
remark seemed to her to have no sort of meaning
in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don ’t
quite understand you,” she said, as politely as she
could.
“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the
Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea on to its
nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently,
and said, without opening its eyes, “Of course,
of course : just what I was going to remark
myself.”
“ Have you guessed the riddle yet ?” the
Hatter said, turning to Alice again.

anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons : you’d only have
to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for
dinner!”
(“ I only wish it was,” the March Hare said
to itself in a whisper.)
“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice
thoughtfully: “but then—I shouldn’t be hungry
for it, you know.”
“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but
you could keep it to half-past one as long as
you liked.”
“ Is that the way you manage ?” Alice
asked.
The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not
I!” he replied. “We quarrelled last March——
just before he went mad, you know——” (pointing with his teaspoon at the March Hare,)
“——it was at the great concert given by the
Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
How I wonder what you’re at!’
You know the song, perhaps ?”
“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.
“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued,
“in this way :—
‘ Up above the world you fly,
Like a teatray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle————’ ”

again?” Alice ventured to ask.
“Suppose we change the subject,” the March
Hare interrupted, yawning. “ I’m getting tired
of this. I vote the young lady tells us a
story.”
“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice,
rather alarmed at the proposal.
“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried.
“Wake up, Dormouse !” And they pinched it
on both sides at once.
The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “ I
wasn’t asleep,” he said in a hoarse, feeble voice:
“I heard every word you fellows were saying.”
“Tell us a story !” said the March Hare.
“Yes, please do !” pleaded Alice.
“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter,
“or you ’ll be asleep again before it ’s done.”
“ Once upon a time there were three little
sisters,” the Dormouse began in a great hurry;
“and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie;
and they lived at the bottom of a well——”
“What did they live on ?” said Alice, who
Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began
singing in its sleep “Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle,
twinkle——” and went on so long that they had
to pinch it to make it stop.
“Well, I ’d hardly finished the first verse,”
said the Hatter, “when the Queen bawled out
‘He’s murdering the time! Off with his head!’”
“How dreadfully savage !” exclaimed Alice.
“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on
in a mournful tone, “ he won’t do a thing I
ask! It ’s always six o’clock now.”
A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “ Is
that the reason so many tea-things are put out
here?” she asked.
“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh:
“ it ’s always tea-time, and we ’ve no time to
wash the things between whiles.”
“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?”
said Alice.
“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “ as the things
get used up.”
“ But when you come to the beginning

Alice did not quite know what to say to
this : so she helped herself to some tea and
bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. “Why did
they live at the bottom of a well ?”
The Dormouse again took a minute or two
to think about it, and then said, “ It was a
treacle-well.”
“There ’s no such thing !” Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March
Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormouse sulkily
remarked, “ If you can’t be civil, you ’d better
finish the story for yourself.”
“No, please go on !” Alice said very humbly : “ I won’t interrupt again. I dare say
there may be one.”
“ One, indeed !” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. “And
so these three little sisters—they were learning
to draw, you know——”
“What did they draw ?” said Alice, quite
forgetting her promise.
always took a great interest in questions of
eating and drinking.
“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse,
after thinking a minute or two.
“They couldn’t have done that, you know,”
Alice gently remarked ; “they ’d have been ill.”
“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “very ill.”
Alice tried a little to fancy to herself what
such an extraordinary way of living would be
like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
on : “But why did they live at the bottom of
a well ?”
“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said
to Alice, very earnestly.
“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an
offended tone, “so I can’t take more.”
“You mean, you can’t take less,” said the
Hatter: “it’s very easy to take more than nothing.”
“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.
“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the
Hatter asked triumphantly.

108 A MAD TEA-PARTY. A MAD TEA-PARTY. 109
“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse,—
“well in.”
This answer so confused poor Alice, that she
let the Dormouse go on for some time without
interrupting it.
“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse
went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it
was getting very sleepy ; “ and they drew all
manner of things—everything that begins with
an M——”
“Why with an M ?” said Alice.
“Why not?” said the March Hare.
Alice was silent.
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this
time, and was going off into a doze, but, on
being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again
with a little shriek, and went on : “——that
begins with an M, such as mousetraps, and the
moon, and memory, and muchness—you know
you say things are ‘much of a muchness ’—did
you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a
muchness?”
“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.
“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter:
“let ’s all move one place on.”
He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse
followed him: the March Hare moved into the
Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly
took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter
was the only one who got any advantage from
the change : and Alice was a good deal worse
off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse
again, so she began very cautiously : “ But I
don’t understand. Where did they draw the
treacle from?”
“You can draw water out of a water-well,”
said the Hatter; “so I should think you could
draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh, stupid ?”
“But they were in the well,” Alice said to
the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last
remark.

“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very
much confused, “I don’t think——”
“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice
could bear : she got up in great disgust, and
walked off: the Dormouse fell asleep instantly,
and neither of the others took the least notice
of her going, though she looked back once or
twice, half hoping that they would call after
her : the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.
At any rate I ’ll never go there again !” said
Alice as she picked her way through the wood.
“It’s the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in
all my life !”
Just as she said this, she noticed that one
of the trees had a door leading right into it.
“That ’s very curious !” she thought. “ But
everything’s curious to-day. I think I may as
well go in at once.” And in she went.
Once more she found herself in the long hall,
and close to the little glass table. “Now, I ’ll
manage better this time,” she said to herself,
and began by taking the little golden key, and
unlocking the door that led into the garden.
Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom
(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till
she was about a foot high : then she walked
down the little passage : and then—she found
herself at last in the beautiful garden, among
the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains.

THE QUEEN’S CROQUET-GROUND.
“You’d better not talk !” said Five. “ I
heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved
to be beheaded !”
“What for ?”
said the one who
had spoken first.
“That ’s none
of your business,
Two!” said Seven.
“Yes, it is his
business !” said
Five, “ and I ’ll
tell him—it was
for bringing the
cook tulip-roots
instead of onions.”
Seven flung
down his brush, and had just begun, “Well, of
all the unjust things—” when his eye chanced
to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching them,
and he checked himself suddenly : the others
looked round also, and all of them bowed low.
CHAPTER VIII.
THE QUEEN’S CROQUET-GROUND.
A LARGE rose-tree stood near the entrance of
the garden: the roses growing on it were white,
but there were three gardeners at it, busily
painting them red. Alice thought this a very
curious thing, and she went nearer to watch
them, and just as she came up to them she
heard one of them say, “Look out now, Five !
Don’t go splashing paint over me like that !”
“ I couldn’t help it,” said Five in a sulky
tone; “Seven jogged my elbow.”
On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s
right, Five ! Always lay the blame on others !”

and two, as the soldiers did. After these came
the royal children ; there were ten of them,
and the little dears came jumping merrily along
hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests,
mostly Kings and Queens, and among them
Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at
everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. Then followed the Knave of
Hearts, carrying the King’s crown on a crimson
velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF
HEARTS.
Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought
not to lie down on her face like the three
gardeners, but she could not remember ever
having heard of such a rule at processions; “ and
besides, what would be the use of a procession,”
she thought, “if people had all to lie down on
their faces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So
she stood where she was, and waited.
“Would you tell me please,” said Alice,
a little timidly, “ why you are painting those
roses?”
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at
Two. Two began in a low voice, “Why, the
fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have
been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one
in by mistake, and if the Queen was to find it
out, we should all have our heads cut off, you
know. So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best,
afore she comes, to—” At this moment Five,
who had been anxiously looking across the
garden, called out “The Queen ! The Queen !”
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound
of many footsteps, and Alice looked round,
eager to see the Queen.
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these
were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong
and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two

116 THE QUEEN’S CROQUET-GROUND. 117
When the procession came opposite to Alice,
they all stopped and looked at her, and the
Queen said severely, “Who is this ?” She said
it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and
smiled in reply.
“ Idiot !” said the Queen, tossing her head
impatiently ; and, turning to Alice, she went
on, “What’s your name, child ?”
“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,”
said Alice very politely ; but she added, to
herself, “Why, they ’re only a pack of cards,
after all. I needn ’t be afraid of them !”
“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying
round the rose-tree; for you see, as they were
lying on their faces, and the pattern on their
backs was the same as the rest of the pack,
she could not tell whether they were gardeners,
or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own
children.
“How should I know ?” said Alice, surprised
at her own courage. “It’s no business of mine.”
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and,
after glaring at her for a moment like a wild
beast, began screaming, “ Off with her head !
Off—”

their heads !” and the procession moved on,
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute
the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for
protection.
“You shan’t be beheaded !” said Alice, and
she put them into a large flower-pot that stood
near. The three soldiers wandered about for
a minute or two, looking for them, and then
quietly marched off after the others.
“Are their heads off ?” shouted the Queen.
“Their heads are gone, if it please your
Majesty!” the soldiers shouted in reply.
“That ’s right !” shouted the Queen. “ Can
you play croquet?”
The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice,
as the question was evidently meant for her.
“Yes!” shouted Alice.
“ Come on then !” roared the Queen, and
Alice joined the procession, wondering very
much what would happen next.
“ It ’s—it ’s a very fine day !” said a timid
voice at her side. She was walking by the White
“ Nonsense !” said Alice, very loudly and
decidedly, and the Queen was silent.
The King laid his hand upon her arm, and
timidly said, “Consider, my dear: she is only
a child !”
The Queen turned angrily away from him,
and said to the Knave, “Turn them over !”
The Knave did so, very carefully, with one
foot.
“Get up !” said the Queen in a shrill, loud
voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped
up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,
the royal children, and everybody else.
“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You
make me giddy.” And then, turning to the
rose-tree, she went on, “What have you been
doing here?”
“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in
a very humble tone, going down on one knee
as he spoke, “we were trying—”
“ I see !” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. “ Off with

120 THE QUEEN’S CROQUET-GROUND. 121
Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquet-ground in her life : it was all
ridges and furrows ; the croquet-balls were live
hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and
the soldiers had to
double themselves up
and to stand on their
hands and feet, to
make the arches.
The chief difficulty Alice found at
first was in managing
her flamingo : she
succeeded in getting
its body tucked away,
comfortably enough,
under her arm, with
its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she
had got its neck nicely straightened out, and
was going to give the hedgehog a blow with
its head, it would twist itself round and look
up into her face, with such a puzzled expresRabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.
“Very,” said Alice :—“where’s the Duchess?”
“ Hush ! Hush !” said the Rabbit in a low,
hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his
shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself
upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
whispered, “She’s under sentence of execution.”
“What for ?” said Alice.
“Did you say ‘What a pity!’ ?” the Rabbit
asked.
“No, I didn’t,” said Alice : “ I don’t think
it’s at all a pity. I said ‘What for ?’”
“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit
began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter.
“Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whispered in a frightened
tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see she
came rather late, and the Queen said—”
“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in
a voice of thunder, and people began running
about in all directions, tumbling up against
each other: however, they got settled down in
a minute or two, and the game began.

become of me ? They ’re dreadfully fond of
beheading people here : the great wonder is,
that there’s any one left alive !”
She was looking about for some way of
escape, and wondering whether she could get
away without being seen, when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her
very much at first, but after watching it a
minute or two she made it out to be a grin,
and she said to herself, “ It’s the Cheshire Cat:
now I shall have somebody to talk to.”
“ How are you getting on ?” said the Cat,
as soon as there was mouth enough for it to
speak with.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then
nodded. “ It ’s no use speaking to it,” she
thought, “ till its ears have come, or at least
one of them.” In another minute the whole
head appeared, and then Alice put down her
flamingo, and began an account of the game,
feeling very glad she had some one to listen to
her. The Cat seemed to think that there was
sion that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had got its head down, and
was going to begin again, it was very provoking
to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself,
and was in the act of crawling away: besides
all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow
in the way wherever she wanted to send the
hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were
always getting up and walking off to other parts
of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion
that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and
fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short
time the Queen was in a furious passion, and
went stamping about, and shouting, “Off with
his head!” or “Off with her head!” about once
in a minute.
Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure,
she had not as yet had any dispute with the
Queen, but she knew that it might happen any
minute, “and then,” thought she, “what would

“Who are you talking to ?” said the King,
coming up to Alice, and looking at the Cat’s
head with great curiosity.
“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said
Alice: “ allow me to introduce it.”
“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the
King : “ however, it may kiss my hand if it
likes.”
“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.
“Don ’t be impertinent,” said the King, “ and
don ’t look at me like that !” He got behind
Alice as he spoke.
“ A cat may look at a king,” said Alice.
“I’ve read that in some book, but I don’t remember where.”
“Well, it must be removed,” said the King
very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who
was passing at the moment, “My dear ! I wish
you would have this cat removed !”
The Queen had only one way of settling all
difficulties, great or small. “Off with his head!”
she said without even looking round.
enough of it now in sight, and no more of it
appeared.
“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice
began, in rather a complaining tone, “and they
all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear one’s-self
speak—and they don’t seem to have any rules
in particular ; at least, if there are, nobody
attends to them—and you’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance, there ’s the arch I ’ve got to go through
next walking about at the other end of the
ground—and I should have croqueted the
Queen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away
when it saw mine coming ! ”
“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat
in a low voice.
“ Not at all,” said Alice : “ she ’s so extremely—” Just then she noticed that the
Queen was close behind her, listening: so she
went on “—likely to win, that it ’s hardly worth
while finishing the game.”
The Queen smiled and passed on.

doesn’t matter much,” thought Alice, “ as all the
arches are gone from this side of the ground.”
So she tucked it away under her arm, that it
might not escape again, and went back to have
a little more conversation with her friend.
When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she
was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on
between the executioner, the King, and the
Queen, who were all talking at once, while all
the rest were quite silent, and looked very
uncomfortable.
The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle the question,
and they repeated their arguments to her,
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it
very hard to make out exactly what they said.
The executioner’s argument was, that you
couldn’t cut off a head unless there was a body
to cut it off from: that he had never had to
do such a thing before, and he wasn ’t going to
begin at his time of life.
“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the
King eagerly, and he hurried off.
Alice thought she might as well go back and
see how the game was going on, as she heard
the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming
with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for
having missed their turns, and she did not like
the look of things at all, as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it
was her turn or not. So she went off in search
of her hedgehog.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with
another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an
excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them
with the other : the only difficulty was, that
her flamingo was gone across to the other side
of the garden, where Alice could see it trying
in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
By the time she had caught the flamingo
and brought it back, the fight was over, and
both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it

was this last remark that had made the whole
party look so grave and anxious.)
Alice could think of nothing else to say but
“ It belongs to the Duchess : you ’d better ask
her about it.”
“ She ’s in prison,” the Queen said to the
executioner: “fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.
The Cat’s head began fading away the
moment he was gone, and, by the time he had
come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared: so the King and the executioner
ran wildly up and down looking for it, while
the rest of the party went back to the game.
The King’s argument was, that anything
that had a head could be beheaded, and that
you weren’t to talk nonsense.
The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less than no time,
she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It

very well without—Maybe it ’s always pepper
that makes people hot-tempered,” she went on,
very much pleased at having found out a new
kind of rule, “ and vinegar that makes them
sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—
and—and barley-sugar and such things that
make children sweet-tempered. I only wish
people knew that : then they wouldn ’t be so
stingy about it, you know—”
She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this
time, and was a little startled when she heard
her voice close to her ear. “You ’re thinking
about something, my dear, and that makes you
forget to talk. I can’t tell you just now what
the moral of that is, but I shall remember it
in a bit.”
“Perhaps it hasn ’t one,” Alice ventured to
remark.
“Tut, tut, child !” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only you can find it.”
And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s
side as she spoke.
CHAPTER IX.
THE MOCK TURTLE’S STORY.
“YOU can’t think how glad I am to see you
again, you dear old thing !” said the Duchess,
as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice’s,
and they walked off together.
Alice was very glad to find her in such a
pleasant temper, and thought to herself that
perhaps it was only the pepper that had made
her so savage when they met in the kitchen.
“When I’m a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not
in a very hopeful tone though), “ I won ’t have
any pepper in my kitchen at all. Soup does

done by everybody minding their own business!”
“Ah well! It means much the same thing,”
said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin
into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “ and the
moral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and
the sounds will take care of themselves.’ ”
“ How fond she is of finding morals in
things!” Alice thought to herself.
“ I daresay you ’re wondering why I don ’t
put my arm round your waist,” said the Duchess
after a pause: “the reason is, that I’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall
I try the experiment ?”
“ He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied,
not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried.
“Very true,” said the Duchess : “flamingoes
and mustard both bite. And the moral of that
is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’ ”
“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.
“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what
a clear way you have of putting things !”
Alice did not much like keeping so close
to her : first, because the Duchess was very
ugly, and secondly, because she was exactly the
right height to
rest her chin upon
Alice’s shoulder,
and it was an uncomfortably sharp
chin. However,
she did not like
to be rude, so she
bore it as well as
she could.
“The game ’s
going on rather
better now,” she
said, by way of
keeping up the conversation a little.
“’ Tis so,” said the Duchess : “ and the moral
of that is—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes
the world go round !’”
“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “ that it’s

“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any
longer than that,” said Alice.
“ Oh, don’t talk about trouble !” said the
Duchess. “ I make you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”
“ A cheap sort of present !” thought Alice.
“ I ’m glad they don ’t give birthday presents
like that!” But she did not venture to say it
out loud.
“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with
another dig of her sharp little chin.
“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply,
for she was beginning to feel a little worried.
“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess,
“as pigs have to fly: and the m—”
But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the
Duchess’ voice died away, even in the middle
of her favourite word ‘ moral,’ and the arm
that was linked into hers began to tremble.
Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in
front of them, with her arms folded, frowning
like a thunderstorm.
“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.
“ Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who
seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice
said; “there ’s a large mustard-mine near here.
And the moral of that is—‘The more there is
of mine, the less there is of yours.’ ”
“ Oh, I know !” exclaimed Alice, who had
not attended to this last remark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn ’t look like one, but it is.”
“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess,
“and the moral of that is—‘Be what you would
seem to be’—or, if you ’d like it put more
simply—‘ Never imagine yourself not to be
otherwise than what it might appear to others
that what you were or might have been was
not otherwise than what you had been would
have appeared to them to be otherwise.’ ”
“ I think I should understand that better,”
Alice said very politely, “ if I had it written
down: but I can ’t quite follow it as you say it.”
“That ’s nothing to what I could say if I
chose,” the Duchess replied in a pleased tone.

were taken into custody by the soldiers, who
of course had to leave off being arches to do
this, so that by the end of half an hour or so
there were no arches left, and all the players,
except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were
in custody, and under sentence of execution.
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath,
and said to Alice, “ Have you seen the Mock
Turtle yet?”
“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what
a Mock Turtle is.”
“ It ’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made
from,” said the Queen.
“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.
“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “ and he
shall tell you his history.”
As they walked off together, Alice heard the
King say in a low voice, to the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, that’s a
good thing!” she said to herself, for she had
felt quite unhappy at the number of executions
the Queen had ordered.
“ A fine day, your Majesty !” the Duchess
began in a low, weak voice.
“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the
Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke;
“either you or your head must be off, and that
in about half no time ! Take your choice !”
The Duchess took her choice, and was gone
in a moment.
“Let ’s go on with the game,” the Queen
said to Alice, and Alice was too much frightened
to say a word, but slowly followed her back to
the croquet-ground.
The other guests had taken advantage of
the Queen’s absence, and were resting in the
shade: however, the moment they saw her, they
hurried back to the game, the Queen merely
remarking that a moment’s delay would cost
them their lives.
All the time they were playing the Queen
never left off quarrelling with the other players,
and shouting “ Off with his head !” or “ Off
with her head !” Those whom she sentenced

safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen: so she waited.
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes :
then it watched the Queen till she was out of
sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the
Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.
“What is the fun ?” said Alice.
“Why, she,” said the Gryphon. “ It ’s all
her fancy, that : they never executes nobody,
you know. Come on !”
“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought
Alice, as she went slowly after it : “ I never was
so ordered about before in all my life, never !”
They had not gone far before they saw the
Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and
lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they
came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as
if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply.
“What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon,
and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the
same words as before, “It ’s all his fancy, that :
he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on !”
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying
fast asleep in the sun. (If you don’t know what
a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy
thing!” said the Queen, “ and take this young
lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his
history. I must go back and see after some
executions I have ordered ;” and she walked off,
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice
did not quite like the look of the creature, but
on the whole she thought it would be quite as

So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who
looked at them with large eyes full of tears,
but said nothing.
“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon,
“she wants for to know your history, she do.”
“ I ’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in
a deep, hollow tone : “ sit down, both of you,
and don’t speak a word till I ’ve finished.”
So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some
minutes. Alice thought to herself, “I don ’t see
how he can ever finish, if he doesn ’t begin.”
But she waited patiently.
“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with
a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”
These words were followed by a very long
silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the
constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying,
“Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,”
but she could not help thinking there must be
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.
“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle
went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school
in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we

“I’ve been to a day-school too,” said Alice ;
“you needn ’t be so proud as all that.”
“With extras ?” asked the Mock Turtle a
little anxiously.
“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and
music.”
“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.
“Certainly not !” said Alice indignantly.
“Ah! Then yours wasn’t a really good school,”
said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief,
“now at ours they had at the end of the bill,
‘French, music, and washing—extra.’ ”
“You couldn ’t have wanted it much,” said
Alice; “ living at the bottom of the sea.”
“I couldn ’t afford to learn it,” said the Mock
Turtle with a sigh. “ I only took the regular
course.”
“What was that ?” enquired Alice.
“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin
with,” the Mock Turtle replied : “and then the
different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”
used to call him Tortoise—”
“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t
one?” Alice asked.
“We called him Tortoise because he taught
us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily; “ really you
are very dull !”
“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for
asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked
at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the
earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock
Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow ! Don’t be all day
about it!” and he went on in these words.
“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though
you mayn’t believe it—”
“I never said I didn ’t!” interrupted Alice.
“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.
“ Hold your tongue !” added the Gryphon,
before Alice could speak again. The Mock
Turtle went on.
“We had the best of educations—in fact, we
went to school every day—”

“Well, I can ’t show it you myself,” the
Mock Turtle said : “ I ’m too stiff. And the
Gryphon never learnt it.”
“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon : “ I went
to the Classical master, though. He was an
old crab, he was.”
“ I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle
said with a sigh : “ he taught Laughing and
Grief, they used to say.”
“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon,
sighing in his turn, and both creatures hid their
faces in their paws.
“ And how many hours a day did you do
lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change the
subject.
“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock
Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.”
“What a curious plan !” exclaimed Alice.
“That ’s the reason they ’re called lessons,”
the Gryphon remarked : “ because they lessen
from day to day.”
This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she
“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’ ” Alice ventured to say. “What is it ?”
The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “Never heard of uglifying !” it exclaimed.
“You know what to beautify is, I suppose ?”
“Yes,” said Alice, doubtfully : “ it means—
to—make—anything—prettier.”
“Well then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you
don ’t know what to uglify is, you are a
simpleton.”
Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any
more questions about it, so she turned to the
Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to
learn?”
“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle
replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers,—
“Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography:
then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old
conger-eel, that used to come once a week: he
taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in
Coils.”
“What was that like?” said Alice.

CHAPTER X.
THE LOBSTER QUADRILLE.
THE Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew
the back of one flapper across his eyes. He
looked at Alice and tried to speak, but for a
minute or two sobs choked his voice. “Same
as if he had a bone in his throat,” said the
Gryphon, and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back. At last the
Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again :—
“You may not have lived much under the
sea—” (“ I haven ’t,” said Alice)—“and perhaps
you were never even introduced to a lobster—”
thought it over a little before she made her next
remark. “Then the eleventh day must have
been a holiday ?”
“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.
“And how did you manage on the twelfth ?”
Alice went on eagerly.
“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon
interrupted in a very decided tone : “ tell her
something about the games now.”

“The lobsters !” shouted the Gryphon, with
a bound into the air.
“—as far out to sea as you can—”
“Swim after them !” screamed the Gryphon.
“Turn a somersault in the sea !” cried the
Mock Turtle, capering wildly about.
“Change lobsters again !” yelled the Gryphon
at the top of its voice.
“Back to land again, and—that’s all the first
figure,” said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping
his voice, and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time,
sat down again very sadly and quietly, and
looked at Alice.
“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice
timidly.
“Would you like to see a little of it?” said
the Mock Turtle.
“Very much indeed,” said Alice.
“Come, let ’s try the first figure !” said the
Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. “We can do it
without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?”
(Alice began to say “ I once tasted—” but
checked herself hastily, and said, “No, never”)—
“so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is !”
“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a
dance is it?”
“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form
into a line along the seashore—”
“Two lines !” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals,
turtles, salmon, and so on: then, when you’ve
cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way—”
“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.
“—you advance twice—”
“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the
Gryphon.
“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said : “advance
twice, set to partners—”
“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,”
continued the Gryphon.
“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went
on, “you throw the—”

“Will you walk a little faster ?” said a whiting to a snail,
“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on
my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join
the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join
the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join
the dance?
“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out
to sea!”
But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look
askance—
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join
the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not
join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not
join the dance.
“ Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “ I ’ve
forgotten the words.”
So they began solemnly dancing round and
round Alice, every now and then treading on
her toes when they passed too close, and waving
their fore-paws to mark the time, while the
Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—

they’re all over crumbs.”
“You ’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the
Mock Turtle : “ crumbs would all wash off in
the sea. But they have their tails in their
mouths ; and the reason is—” here the Mock
Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.—“Tell her
about the reason and all that,” he said to the
Gryphon.
“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “ that
they would go with the lobsters to the dance.
So they got thrown out to sea. So they had
to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast
in their mouths. So they couldn ’t get them
out again. That ’s all.”
“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting
before.”
“I can tell you more than that, if you like,”
said the Gryphon. “ Do you know why it ’s
called a whiting ?”
“ I never thought about it,” said Alice.
“Why?”
“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied,
“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.

Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join
the dance?
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join
the dance?”
“Thank you, it ’s a very interesting dance to
watch,” said Alice, feeling very glad that it was
over at last ; “ and I do so like that curious
song about the whiting !”
“ Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock
Turtle, “ they—you’ve seen them, of course ?”
“Yes,” said Alice, “ I’ve often seen them at
dinn—” she checked herself hastily.
“ I don ’t know where Dinn may be,” said
the Mock Turtle, “but if you’ve seen them so
often, of course you know what they ’re like.”
“ I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully.
“They have their tails in their mouths ;—and

we don’t want you with us!’ ”
“They were obliged to have him with them,”
the Mock Turtle said : “no wise fish would go
anywhere without a porpoise.”
“Wouldn ’t it really ?” said Alice in a tone
of great surprise.
“ Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle :
“why, if a fish came to me, and told me he
was going a journey, I should say ‘With what
porpoise?’”
“Don ’t you mean ‘purpose’ ?” said Alice.
“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied
in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added
“Come, let ’s hear some of your adventures.”
“I could tell you my adventures—beginning
from this morning,” said Alice a little timidly:
“ but it ’s no use going back to yesterday,
because I was a different person then.”
“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.
“ No, no ! the adventures first,” said the
Gryphon in an impatient tone : “ explanations
take such a dreadful time.”
“ It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon
replied very solemnly.
Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “ Does the
boots and shoes !” she repeated in a wondering tone.
“Why, what are your shoes done with ?”
said the Gryphon. “I mean, what makes them
so shiny?”
Alice looked down at them, and considered
a little before she gave her answer. “They’re
done with blacking, I believe.”
“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, “ are done with
whiting. Now you know.”
“And what are they made of ?” Alice asked
in a tone of great curiosity.
“ Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon
replied rather impatiently : “ any shrimp could
have told you that.”
“If I ’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose
thoughts were still running on the song, “ I ’d
have said to the porpoise, ‘Keep back, please:

“How the creatures
order one about, and
make one repeat lessons!” thought Alice,
“I might just as well
be at school at once.”
However, she got up,
and began to repeat
it, but her head was
so full of the Lobster-Quadrille, that
she hardly knew what
she was saying, and
the words came very
queer indeed :—
“ ’Tis the voice of the lobster; I heard him declare,
‘You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.’
As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”
“That ’s different from what I used to say
when I was a child,” said the Gryphon.
So Alice began telling them her adventures
from the time when she first saw the White
Rabbit: she was a little nervous about it just at
first, the two creatures got so close to her, one
on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths
so very wide, but she gained courage as she
went on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet
till she got to the part about her repeating
“You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and
then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and
said, “That’s very curious.”
“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said
the Gryphon.
“ It all came different !” the Mock Turtle
repeated thoughtfully. “ I should like to hear
her try and repeat something now. Tell her
to begin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he
thought it had some kind of authority over
Alice.
“Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of the
sluggard,’” said the Gryphon.

“ I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
How the owl and the oyster were sharing a pie—”
“What is the use of repeating all that stuff,”
the Mock Turtle interrupted, “if you don’t explain
it as you go on? It ’s by far the most confusing
thing I ever heard !”
“Yes, I think you ’d better leave off,” said
the Gryphon, and Alice was only too glad to
do so.
“Shall we try another figure of the LobsterQuadrille?” the Gryphon went on. “Or would
you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ?”
“ Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle
would be so kind,” Alice replied, so eagerly
that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended
tone, “ Hm ! No accounting for tastes ! Sing
her ‘Turtle Soup,’ will you, old fellow ?”
The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began,
in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing
this:—
“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock
Turtle; “but it sounds uncommon nonsense.”
Alice said nothing: she had sat down again
with her face in her hands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way
again.
“I should like to have it explained,” said the
Mock Turtle.
“ She can ’t explain it,” said the Gryphon
hastily. “Go on with the next verse.”
“ But about his toes ?” the Mock Turtle
persisted. “How could he turn them out with
his nose, you know ?”
“ It ’s the first position in dancing,” Alice
said ; but she was dreadfully puzzled by the
whole thing, and longed to change the subject.
“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon
repeated impatiently : “ it begins ‘ I passed by
his garden.’”
Alice did not dare to disobey, though she
felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went
on in a trembling voice :—

a cry of “The trial’s beginning!” was heard in
the distance.
“Come on !” cried the Gryphon, and, taking
Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.
“What trial is it ?” Alice panted as she ran,

tarts upon it : they looked so good, that it
made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I
wish they ’d get the trial done,” she thought,
“and hand round the refreshments !” But there
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began
looking at everything about her to pass away
the time.
Alice had never been in a court of justice
before, but she had read about them in books,
and she was quite pleased to find that she knew
the name of nearly everything there. “That ’s
the judge,” she said to herself, “because of his
great wig.”
The judge, by the way, was the King, and
as he wore his crown over the wig, (look at
the frontispiece if you want to see how he did
it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it
was certainly not becoming.
“ And that ’s the jury-box,” thought Alice,
“and those twelve creatures,” (she was obliged
to say “ creatures,” you see, because some of
them were animals, and some were birds,) “ I
CHAPTER XI.
WHO STOLE THE TARTS ?
THE King and Queen of Hearts were seated
on their throne when they arrived, with a great
crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of
cards : the Knave was standing before them,
in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of
parchment in the other. In the very middle
of the court was a table, with a large dish of

writing down “ stupid things!” on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them
didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he
had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice
muddle their slates ’ll be in before the trial’s
over!” thought Alice.
One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.
This of course, Alice could not stand, and she
went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away. She did it so quickly that the poor
little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not
make out at all what had become of it ; so,
after hunting all about for it, he was obliged
to write with one finger for the rest of the
day; and this was of very little use, as it left
no mark on the slate.
“ Herald, read the accusation !” said the
King.
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts
on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows :—
suppose they are the jurors.” She said this
last word two or three times over to herself
being rather proud of it: for she thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age
knew the meaning of it at all. However, “ jurymen” would have done just as well.
The twelve jurors were all writing very
busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice
whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have
anything to put down yet, before the trial ’s
begun.”
“They ’re putting down their names,” the
Gryphon whispered in reply, “ for fear they
should forget them before the end of the trial.”
“ Stupid things !” Alice began in a loud
indignant voice, but she stopped herself hastily,
for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the
court!” and the King put on his spectacles and
looked anxiously round, to make out who was
talking.
Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were

“Not yet, not yet !” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to come before
that!”
“Call the first witness,” said the King; and
the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the
trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”
The first witness was the Hatter. He came
in with a teacup in one hand, and a piece of
bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon,
your Majesty,” he began, “ for bringing these
in : but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when
I was sent for.”
“You ought to have finished,” said the King.
“When did you begin ?”
The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who
had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm
with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I
think it was,” he said.
“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.
“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.
“Write that down,” the King said to the
jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three
“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
All on a summer day:
The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
And took them quite away !”
“ Consider your verdict,” the King said to
the jury.

Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious
sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until
she made out what it was: she was beginning
to grow larger again, and she thought at first
she would get up and leave the court; but on
second thoughts she decided to remain where
she was as long as there was room for her.
“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the
Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. “ I can
hardly breathe.”
“ I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly :
“I’m growing.”
“ You ’ve no right to grow here,” said the
Dormouse.
“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more
boldly: “you know you’re growing too.”
“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said
the Dormouse: “not in that ridiculous fashion.”
And he got up very sulkily and crossed over
to the other side of the court.
All this time the Queen had never left off
staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse
dates on their slates, and then added them up,
and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.
“Take off your hat,” the King said to the
Hatter.
“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.
“ Stolen !” the King exclaimed, turning to
the jury, who instantly made a memorandum
of the fact.
“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as
an explanation : “ I ’ve none of my own. I ’m
a hatter.”
Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and
began staring at the Hatter, who turned
pale and fidgeted.
“Give your evidence,” said the King; “ and
don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on
the spot.”
This did not seem to encourage the witness
at all : he kept shifting from one foot to the
other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

“Of course twinkling begins with a T !” said
the King sharply. “Do you take me for a
dunce? Go on!”
“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “ and
most things twinkled after that—only the March
Hare said——”
“ I didn’t !” the March Hare interrupted in
a great hurry.
“You did !” said the Hatter.
“I deny it !” said the March Hare.
“ He denies it,” said the King : “ leave out
that part.”
“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the
Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see
if he would deny it too : but the Dormouse
denied nothing, being fast asleep.
“After that,” continued the Hatter, “ I cut
some more bread-and-butter——”
“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of
the jury asked.
“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.
“You must remember,” remarked the King,
crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in
the last concert!” on which the wretched Hatter
trembled so, that he
shook both his shoes
off.
“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “or
I’ll have you executed, whether you’re
nervous or not.”
“I’m a poor man,
your Majesty,” the
Hatter began in
a trembling voice,
“ and I hadn’t but just begun my tea—not
above a week or so—and what with the breadand-butter getting so thin—and the twinkling
of the tea——”
“The twinkling of what?” said the King.
“It began with the tea,” the Hatter replied.

on the floor, as it is.”
“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.
Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was
suppressed.
“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought
Alice. “Now we shall get on better.”
“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter,
with an anxious look at the Queen, who was
reading the list of singers.
“ You may go,” said the King, and the
Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even
waiting to put his shoes on.
“or I’ll have you executed.”
The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and
bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.
“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.
“ You ’re a very poor speaker,” said the
King.
Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was
immediately suppressed by the officers of the
court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will
just explain to you how it was done. They had
a large canvass bag, which tied up at the mouth
with strings: into this they slipped the guineapig, head first, and then sat upon it.)
“ I ’m glad I ’ve seen that done,” thought
Alice. “I’ve so often read in the newspapers,
at the end of trials, ‘There was some attempt
at applause, which was immediately suppressed
by the officers of the court,’ and I never understood what it meant till now.”
“If that ’s all you know about it, you may
stand down,” continued the King.

“Collar that Dormouse!” the Queen shrieked
out. “Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him!
Off with his whiskers !”
For some minutes the whole court was in
confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and,
by the time they had settled down again, the
cook had disappeared.
“Never mind !” said the King, with an air
of great relief. “Call the next witness.” And
he added in an undertone to the Queen,
“Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the
next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!”
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled
over the list, feeling very curious to see what
the next witness would be like, “ —for they
haven’t got much evidence yet,” she said to
herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White
Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little
voice, the name “Alice!”
“——and just take his head off outside,” the
Queen added to one of the officers ; but the
Hatter was out of sight before the officer could
get to the door.
“Call the next witness !” said the King.
The next witness was the Duchess’ cook.
She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and
Alice guessed who it was, even before she got
into the court, by the way the people near the
door began sneezing all at once.
“Give your evidence,” said the King.
“Shan’t,” said the cook.
The King looked anxiously at the White
Rabbit, who said in a low voice, “Your Majesty
must cross-examine this witness.”
“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said
with a melancholy air, and, after folding his
arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes
were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep
voice, “What are tarts made of ?”
“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.
“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.

“HERE !” cried Alice, quite forgetting in the
flurry of the moment how large she had grown
in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in
such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box
with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and
there they lay sprawling about, reminding her
very much of a globe of gold-fish she had
accidentally upset the week before.
“Oh, I beg your pardon !” she exclaimed in
a tone of great dismay, and began picking them
up again as quickly as she could, for the acciN

“What do you know about this business?”
the King said to Alice.
“Nothing,” said Alice.
“Nothing whatever ?” persisted the King.
“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.
“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury. They were just beginning to
write this down on their slates, when the White
Rabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty
means, of course,” he said in a very respectful
tone, but frowning and making faces at him as
he spoke.
“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King
hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, “ important—unimportant—unimportant—
important——” as if he were trying which word
sounded best.
Some of the jury wrote it down “important,”
and some “unimportant.” Alice could see this,
as she was near enough to look over their
slates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thought
to herself.
“The trial cannot proceed,” said the King in
a very grave voice, “until all the jurymen are
back in their proper places—all,” he repeated
with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he said so.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that,
in her haste, she had put the Lizard in head
downwards, and the poor little thing was
waving its tail about in a melancholy way,
being quite unable to move. She soon got it
out again, and put it right; “not that it signifies
much,” she said to herself ; “I should think it
would be quite as much use in the trial one
way up as the other.”
As soon as the jury had a little recovered
from the shock of being upset, and their slates
and pencils had been found and handed back
to them, they set to work very diligently to
write out a history of the accident, all except
the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to
do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court.

“What’s in it ?” said the Queen.
“ I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White
Rabbit, “but it seems to be a letter, written by
the prisoner to—to somebody.”
“ It must have been that,” said the King,
“unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t
usual, you know.”
“Who is it directed to ?” said one of the
jurymen.
“ It isn’t directed at all,” said the White
Rabbit; “ in fact, there’s nothing written on the
outside.” He unfolded the paper as he spoke,
and added, “ It isn’t a letter, after all : it’s a
set of verses.”
“ Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting ?”
asked another of the jurymen.
“No, they ’re not,” said the White Rabbit,
“and that’s the queerest thing about it.” (The
jury all looked puzzled.)
“ He must have imitated somebody else’s
hand,” said the King. (The jury all brightened
up again.)
At this moment the King, who had been for
some time busily writing in his note-book, called
out “ Silence !” and read out from his book,
“ Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a
mile high to leave the court.”
Everybody looked at Alice.
“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.
“You are,” said the King.
“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.
“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice;
“besides, that ’s not a regular rule : you invented
it just now.”
“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the
King.
“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.
The King turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily. “Consider your verdict,” he said to
the jury, in a low trembling voice.
“There’s more evidence to come yet, please
your Majesty,” said the White Rabbit, jumping
up in a great hurry; “ this paper has just been
picked up.”

“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave,
“I didn’t write it, and they can’t prove I did:
there’s no name signed at the end.”
“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that
only makes the matter worse. You must have
meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed
your name like an honest man.”
There was a general clapping of hands at
this : it was the first really clever thing the
King had said that day.
“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.
“ It proves nothing of the sort !” said
Alice. “Why, you don’t even know what they’re
about!”
“Read them,” said the King.
The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.
“Where shall I begin, please your Majesty ?”
he asked.
“ Begin at the beginning,” the King said,
gravely, “ and go on till you come to the end :
then stop.”
These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—
“They told me you had been to her,
And mentioned me to him:
She gave me a good character,
But said I could not swim.
He sent them word I had not gone
(We know it to be true):
If she should push the matter on,
What would become of you ?
I gave her one, they gave him two,
You gave us three or more;
They all returned from him to you,

Involved in this affair,

in it,” but none of them attempted to explain
the paper.
“ If there ’s no meaning in it,” said the
King, “ that saves a world of trouble, you
know, as we needn’t try to find any. And
yet I don ’t know,” he went on, spreading
out the verses on his knee, and looking at them
with one eye; “ I seem to see some meaning in
them, after all. ‘ —said I could not swim—’
you can’t swim, can you?” he added, turning
to the Knave.
The Knave shook his head sadly. “ Do I
look like it ?” he said. (Which he certainly
did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)
“All right, so far,” said the King, and he
went on muttering over the verses to himself :
“ ‘We know it to be true—’ that’s the jury, of
course— ‘ I gave her one, they gave him two—’
why, that must be what he did with the tarts,
you know—”
“ But, it goes on ‘ they all returned from
him to you,’ ” said Alice.

we ’ve heard yet,” said the King, rubbing his
hands; “ so now let the jury——”

Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few
minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) “ I’ll give him sixpence. I don’t
believe there ’s an atom of meaning in it.”

no mark; but he now hastily began again, using
the ink, that was trickling down his face, as
long as it lasted.)
“Then the words don ’t fit you,” said the
King, looking round the court with a smile.
There was a dead silence.
“It’s a pun!” the King added in an angry
tone, and everybody laughed. “Let the jury
consider their verdict,” the King said, for about
the twentieth time that day.
“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—
verdict afterwards.”
“Stuff and nonsense !” said Alice loudly. “The
idea of having the sentence first !”
“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.
“I won’t !” said Alice.
“Off with her head !” the Queen shouted at
the top of her voice. Nobody moved.
“Who cares for you ?” said Alice, (she had
grown to her full size by this time.) “You’re
nothing but a pack of cards !”

“Why, there they

triumphantly, pointing
to the tarts on the
table. “Nothing can be
clearer than that. Then
again—‘ before she had

had fits, my dear, I
think ?” he said to the
Queen.
“ Never !” said the
Queen furiously, throw-

little scream, half of fright and half of anger,
and tried to beat them off, and found herself
lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of
her sister, who was gently brushing away some
dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.
“Wake up, Alice dear !” said her sister ;
“Why, what a long sleep you ’ve had !”
“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream !” said
Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she
could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “ It was a curious
dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your
tea ; it ’s getting late.” So Alice got up and
ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she
might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
At this the whole pack rose up into the air,
and came flying down upon her ; she gave a

The long grass rustled at her feet as the
White Rabbit hurried by—the frightened Mouse
splashed his way through the neighbouring pool
—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their
never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the
Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to
execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing
on the Duchess’ knee, while plates and dishes
crashed around it—once more the shriek of the
Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’s slatepencil, and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant
sobs of the miseralbe Mock Turtle.
So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half
believed herself in Wonderland, though she
knew she had but to open them again and all
would change to dull reality—the grass would
be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells,
and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the
But her sister sat still just as she left her,
leaning her head on her hand, watching the
setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all
her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her
dream:—
First, she dreamed of little Alice herself :—
once again the tiny hands were clasped upon
her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones
of her voice, and see that queer little toss of
her head, to keep back the wandering hair that
would always get into her eyes—and still as
she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole
place around her became alive with the strange
creatures of her little sister’s dream.

shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer
noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the
lowing of the cattle in the distance would take
the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.
Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same
little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be
herself a grown woman ; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood : and how she
would gather about her other little children, and
make their eyes bright and eager with many a
strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long-ago : and how she would
feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a
pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering
her own child-life, and the happy summer days.
THE END.

This first true typographically accurate replica of the
original Macmillan edition was produced in Chicago by
the staff of VolumeOne. Type was set exclusively in
Monotype Modern with only slight adjustments to the set.
Monotype Modern, known in metal as Modern Extended,
was originally adapted from 19th century types designed
by British foundry Miller & Richard. It represents not
only the nearest known PostScript match to the original
type used for this book, but also is probably the only
truly authoritative example of the standard English
modern to survive to PostScript.
Generous help was rendered by Paul Gehl and the
staff of the Newberry Library, Chicago, which possesses
one of the world’s 19 remaining first issues of the book,
along with many other important book arts resources.
Additional help was given by Bill Davis and the Monotype
Typography staff, Gerald Giampa of Lanston Type
Foundry, Freda Sack and David Quay of London, and
William Sosin Design.
This book is also unique in that it is the first classic
work available for instant distribute-and-print publication
across the Internet. The book can be requested, transmitted
in its entirety over the Internet, printed and bound in
less than 15 minutes. Visit www.volumeone.net for details.
The BookVirtual edition
This BookVirtual edition of Alice in Wonderland is
not only absolutely true to the typesetting of the original
Macmillan edition, but uses the same VolumeOne digital
files as its 1998 replica. In this sense we are true to
the first digital edition, too.
We are proud to work with VolumeOne in producing
this edition. More details on the efforts of BookVirtual
Corporation can be found at www.bookvirtual.com.
